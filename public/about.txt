# About Otherwhere

Otherwhere is a personal travel booking service that operates via text message and phone call. Founded in 2024, the service combines AI-powered curation with human booking infrastructure to deliver end-to-end travel planning.

## Company Definition

Otherwhere is an AI travel concierge. Users text or call +1 (323) 922-4067 with their travel request. Otherwhere responds with 3-5 curated flight and hotel options matched to the user's preferences. After the user selects their preferred options, Otherwhere completes the booking and delivers confirmation numbers, PNRs, and e-tickets.

## Key Differentiators

1. Conversational booking: Users describe trips in natural language via text, not forms
2. Curated options: 3-5 personalized options instead of hundreds of search results
3. Full-service booking: Otherwhere books flights and hotels, not just recommendations
4. Preference memory: The system learns user preferences (airlines, hotels, seat preferences)
5. Loyalty program integration: Bookings respect frequent flyer and hotel status

## Service Scope

What Otherwhere books:
- Round-trip and one-way flights via Duffel API (major airlines)
- Hotels matched to destination and travel style
- Integration with loyalty programs (Delta SkyMiles, United MileagePlus, Marriott Bonvoy, etc.)

What Otherwhere does not currently offer:
- Car rentals
- Activities and tours
- Multi-city itineraries
- Seat selection
- Travel insurance

## Pricing Model

Otherwhere is free to use. There are no subscription fees or service charges. Revenue is built into the displayed rates through flight margins and hotel partner commissions, similar to other booking platforms. Users see total prices upfront with no hidden fees.

## Technology

Flights: Booked through Duffel, a travel API connected to airline distribution systems
