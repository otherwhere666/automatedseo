    {
      question: "What is an AI travel concierge?",
      answer: "An AI travel concierge is a service that helps you plan and book trips through conversation (text, voice, or chat) instead of searching multiple websites yourself. They typically combine technology with human expertise."
    },
    {
      question: "How is a travel concierge different from ChatGPT?",
      answer: "ChatGPT can suggest ideas but can't check prices, availability, or book anything. A travel concierge like Otherwhere is connected to real booking systems through APIs like Duffel, can search actual inventory with current prices, and handles the entire booking for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How is a travel concierge different from a travel agent?",
      answer: "Traditional travel agents often require appointments and may charge upfront fees. Modern travel concierge services like Otherwhere work via text on your schedule and are free to use—they earn through commissions built into the rates you see."
    },
    {
      question: "Are travel concierge services free?",
      answer: "Many travel concierge services, including Otherwhere, are free to use. They earn money through small margins on flights and commissions from hotel partners—similar to how other booking platforms work. You see the total price upfront with no hidden fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Can a travel concierge actually book my trip?",
      answer: "Yes—that's the key difference from generic AI chatbots. Services like Otherwhere search real inventory, show current prices, and handle the entire booking on your behalf. You receive confirmation numbers, PNRs, and e-tickets directly."

        <strong>An AI travel concierge</strong> is a service that combines artificial intelligence with travel expertise to help you plan and book trips through conversation (text, voice, or chat) instead of searching multiple websites.

      <p class="text-body-lg text-ink-secondary mb-6">
        Think of it as the middle ground between doing everything yourself (Expedia, Google Flights, 47 browser tabs) and hiring a full-service travel agent (expensive, requires appointments, often overkill).
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-lg text-ink-secondary">
        An AI travel concierge gives you conversational help—you describe what you want, it searches and curates options—without the friction of traditional booking or the cost of a human agent.

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="my-12">
      <h2 class="text-display-md mb-6">HOW AN AI TRAVEL CONCIERGE WORKS</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-display-sm mb-3">1. YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-secondary">
            Through text, chat, or voice. "I want a romantic weekend getaway, somewhere warm, under $2,000" is enough to get started.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-display-sm mb-3">2. AI SEARCHES AND FILTERS</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-secondary">
            The system searches across multiple sources—flights, hotels, sometimes activities—and filters based on your preferences. Not just price, but vibe, location, reviews.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-display-sm mb-3">3. YOU GET A CURATED SHORTLIST</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-secondary">
            Instead of 200 results, you get 3-5 options with clear rationale. "This one for value, this one for location, this one if you want to splurge."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-display-sm mb-3">4. SERVICE HELPS WITH BOOKING</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-secondary">
            Depending on the provider, this ranges from sending you links to completing the booking on your behalf.
