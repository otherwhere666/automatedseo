  quickTake="Bali has an Instagram problem — the famous spots are overrun and underwhelming in person. The island rewards going where the influencers aren't: the east coast, the mountains, the unglamorous towns with real Balinese culture. Traffic is brutal, so pick one area and commit."
  travelerTypes={[
    {
      name: "The Wellness/Retreat Seeker",
      stayIn: "Ubud (north of town) or Sidemen",
      why: "Ubud's rice paddies and yoga scene are real, but stay north of the center to escape the crowds. Sidemen is the quieter alternative — Mount Agung views, rice terraces, fewer tourists, authentic village feel.",
      pick: "Boutique resort with rice field views north of Ubud",
      price: "~$150-400/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Beach + Nightlife Balance",
      stayIn: "Canggu or Sanur",
      why: "Canggu has the surf scene, beach clubs, and digital nomad energy — lively but not trashy like Kuta. Sanur is the opposite: calm, family-friendly, with a long beach promenade and an old-school Bali feel.",
      pick: "Design hotel in Canggu or beachfront resort in Sanur",
      price: "~$100-300/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Luxury Escape",
      stayIn: "Uluwatu or East Bali (Amankila area)",
      why: "Uluwatu's clifftop resorts have the dramatic Indian Ocean views. East Bali around Candidasa has the island's most exclusive resorts (Amankila) with almost no tourists. Both require commitment — you won't leave the property much.",
      pick: "Clifftop villa in Uluwatu or luxury resort in East Bali",
      price: "~$400-1,200/night"

    { name: "Kuta/Legian", reason: "The Cancún of Bali. Loud, drunk, and nothing like the island you came for. Even the beach is mediocre." },
    { name: "Seminyak main strip", reason: "Used to be cool, now mostly tourist restaurants and traffic. The better Seminyak spots are hidden, and Canggu does it better anyway." },
    { name: "Ubud town center hotels", reason: "The center is a traffic-clogged mess. Stay 10-15 minutes north and you'll have the rice paddies and peace you imagined." }
