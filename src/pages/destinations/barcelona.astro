  quickTake="Barcelona has a tourist-trap problem in its most famous areas. The neighborhoods that locals love — Gràcia, Poble Sec, Sant Antoni — are a 10-minute metro from the cruise-ship chaos but feel like a different city. Stay in the real Barcelona and visit the landmarks."

    {
      name: "The First-Timer",
      stayIn: "Eixample (right side) or El Born",
      why: "Eixample gives you the Gaudí architecture on your doorstep with solid restaurants and easy metro access. El Born is smaller, more walkable, with better nightlife and proximity to the beach. Both are central without being overrun.",
      pick: "Boutique hotel in Eixample Dreta or El Born",
      price: "~$180-300/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Food/Design Obsessive",
      stayIn: "Sant Antoni or Poble Sec",
      why: "Sant Antoni has the best market in the city (Mercat de Sant Antoni) and a thriving vermouth culture. Poble Sec is where chefs open their second restaurants. Both are residential-feeling with serious food.",
      pick: "Design hotel in Sant Antoni",
      price: "~$150-280/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Beach + City Balance",
      stayIn: "Barceloneta or Poblenou",
      why: "Barceloneta puts you on the beach but it's crowded and touristy. Poblenou is the smarter play — beach access, former industrial buildings turned into cool hotels, and a local feel. Think Brooklyn-by-the-sea.",
      pick: "Converted warehouse hotel in Poblenou",
      price: "~$200-350/night"

    { name: "Las Ramblas hotels", reason: "Loud, overpriced, and pickpocket central. Locals avoid Las Ramblas entirely. Stay two blocks away and you're in a different world." },
    { name: "Gothic Quarter budget hotels", reason: "The narrow streets trap noise and the buildings are old in a bad way. The area is beautiful to walk through, not sleep in." },
    { name: "Diagonal Mar / Forum area", reason: "Modern, soulless, far from everything. Built for conventions, not travelers. You'll spend your trip on the metro." }
