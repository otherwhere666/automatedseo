  quickTake="The Amalfi Coast is gorgeous and logistically annoying. The famous towns (Positano, Amalfi) are crowded and car-free — you'll haul luggage up hundreds of steps. The coast rewards strategic planning: pick one base, book boats instead of buses, and visit the famous spots rather than sleep in them."
  travelerTypes={[
    {
      name: "The First-Timer",
      stayIn: "Positano (upper town) or Praiano",
      why: "Positano is the postcard view, and it's worth experiencing once despite the crowds. Stay high in the town for better value and views. Praiano is 10 minutes away, quieter, with the same dramatic setting and easier beach access.",
      pick: "Boutique hotel with terrace in upper Positano or Praiano",
      price: "~$400-700/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Luxury Seeker",
      stayIn: "Ravello or Hotel Santa Caterina (Amalfi)",
      why: "Ravello sits above the coast with gardens, classical music festivals, and a refined calm that the beach towns lack. It's where Jackie O and Gore Vidal stayed. The legendary cliff-side hotels here justify the splurge.",
      pick: "Grand hotel in Ravello with infinity pool",
      price: "~$600-1,200/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Island Escape",
      stayIn: "Capri",
      why: "Technically not the Amalfi Coast, but the ferry makes it easy. Capri has the glamour, the shopping, and car-free ease that the mainland struggles with. Day-trippers leave by 5pm; staying overnight reveals the real island.",
      pick: "Boutique hotel in Capri town or Anacapri",
      price: "~$350-800/night"

    { name: "Amalfi town center", reason: "The town itself is fine but unremarkable — it's a transit hub, not a destination. Visit the cathedral and move on." },
    { name: "Sorrento as your only base", reason: "Sorrento is the gateway but it's not on the Amalfi Coast — it's a separate peninsula. You'll spend hours on buses to see what you came for." },
    { name: "Driving yourself", reason: "The coastal road is single-lane, cliff-edge, and terrifying. Buses and boats exist for a reason. Hire a driver if you must." }
