  quickTake="Kyoto is Japan's cultural heart, but overtourism has hit hard. The famous spots (Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama) are packed by 9am. The solution: stay in traditional ryokans, time your temple visits for early morning or late afternoon, and explore the neighborhoods that tourists skip. Kyoto rewards those who slow down."

    {
      name: "The First-Timer",
      stayIn: "Gion or Higashiyama",
      why: "Gion is the geisha district — machiya townhouses, tea houses, the most photogenic streets in Japan. Higashiyama puts you walking distance to the eastern temple circuit. Both areas let you experience old Kyoto on foot. Stay in a ryokan for at least one night.",
      pick: "Traditional ryokan in Gion or boutique machiya hotel in Higashiyama",
      price: "~$300-600/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Ryokan Purist",
      stayIn: "Northern Higashiyama or Arashiyama",
      why: "The most atmospheric ryokans are slightly outside the center. Northern Higashiyama near Nanzen-ji has luxury ryokans with private gardens. Arashiyama has the bamboo grove and traditional inns along the river. Both require taxis but deliver the Japan you came for.",
      pick: "Luxury ryokan near Nanzen-ji with kaiseki dinner included",
      price: "~$500-1,200/night (includes dinner and breakfast)"
    },
    {
      name: "The Modern Design Seeker",
      stayIn: "Karasuma/Downtown or Kyoto Station area",
      why: "Not all of Kyoto is ancient. Downtown has design hotels and excellent restaurants. The Kyoto Station area has Aman Kyoto's minimalist aesthetic and Ace Hotel's contemporary take. If you want modern Japan with Kyoto day trips, these deliver.",
      pick: "Design hotel downtown or Aman Kyoto",
      price: "~$250-800/night"

    { name: "Visiting Fushimi Inari at midday", reason: "The torii gate tunnel is magical at 6am and miserable at noon. Go at dawn or skip it entirely — you'll spend more time in crowds than appreciating the shrine." },
    { name: "Arashiyama on weekends", reason: "The bamboo grove becomes a shuffling queue of tourists. Visit on a Tuesday morning or accept that you'll see more phones than bamboo." },
    { name: "Rushing between temples", reason: "Kyoto has 2,000 temples. You're not seeing them all. Pick 3-4 per day maximum and actually sit in the gardens. The city rewards patience." }
