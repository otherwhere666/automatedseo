  quickTake="Dubai is polarizing — either you embrace the maximalist luxury or you don't get it. What's undeniable: the hotels are extraordinary, the service is impeccable, and it works as a stopover better than anywhere else. The city is designed for consumption. Know that going in and you'll have a surprisingly good time."

    {
      name: "The Beach Resort Seeker",
      stayIn: "Jumeirah Beach or Palm Jumeirah",
      why: "The beachfront hotels here are genuinely world-class — private beaches, multiple pools, restaurants you don't need to leave for. Palm Jumeirah has the iconic resorts (Atlantis, One&Only). Jumeirah Beach is slightly more accessible and better for day trips into the city.",
      pick: "Beachfront resort on Jumeirah or Palm Jumeirah",
      price: "~$400-900/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Stopover Strategist",
      stayIn: "Downtown Dubai or DIFC",
      why: "If you're passing through for 1-2 nights, stay central. Downtown has the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, and the Address hotels. DIFC is the financial district with excellent restaurants and a more grown-up vibe. Both put you near what's worth seeing without beach-resort commitment.",
      pick: "Luxury hotel in Downtown with Burj Khalifa views",
      price: "~$300-600/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Ultra-Luxury Experience",
      stayIn: "Burj Al Arab or One&Only Royal Mirage",
      why: "If you're doing Dubai, do Dubai. The Burj Al Arab is an icon for a reason — butler service, underwater restaurant, helipad tennis. One&Only Royal Mirage has Arabian fantasy architecture and more understated elegance. Both are once-in-a-lifetime stays.",
      pick: "Suite at Burj Al Arab or beachfront villa at One&Only",
      price: "~$1,500-5,000/night"

    { name: "Deira old town hotels", reason: "The historic district has character but infrastructure is dated. You'll feel disconnected from modern Dubai and the beaches are far." },
    { name: "Business hotels in Internet City", reason: "Corporate parks with nothing walkable. Fine for conferences, pointless for leisure." },
    { name: "Budget hotels anywhere", reason: "Dubai doesn't do budget well. Mid-range here feels cheap. Either commit to the luxury experience or save Dubai for when you can." }
