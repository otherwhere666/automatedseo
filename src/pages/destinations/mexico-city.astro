  quickTake="Mexico City is massive and traffic is brutal — your neighborhood choice determines your trip more than anywhere else. The good news: the best areas (Roma, Condesa, Polanco) are genuinely world-class for food and culture. Stay in one, explore on foot, and Uber strategically for the rest."
  travelerTypes={[
    {
      name: "The First-Timer",
      stayIn: "Roma Norte or Condesa",
      why: "Adjacent neighborhoods with tree-lined streets, the best restaurants in the city, and a walkable European feel. Roma Norte has more edge and galleries; Condesa has parks and cafés. You can't go wrong with either.",
      pick: "Boutique hotel on a quiet Roma Norte street",
      price: "~$150-300/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Food Obsessive",
      stayIn: "Roma Norte (near Mercado Roma) or Juárez",
      why: "Roma Norte has the highest restaurant density in the city — from tasting menus to taquerías. Juárez is adjacent and slightly grittier, with natural wine bars and chefs' passion projects. This is where Mexico City's food reputation lives.",
      pick: "Design hotel walking distance to Contramar",
      price: "~$180-350/night"
    },
    {
      name: "The Luxury Traveler",
      stayIn: "Polanco",
      why: "Mexico City's Beverly Hills — wide boulevards, high-end shopping, museum row (Soumaya, Jumex, Anthropology). The grand hotels are here, and it's notably safe and polished. Less gritty charm, more reliable comfort.",
      pick: "Luxury hotel near Parque Lincoln",
      price: "~$300-600/night"

    { name: "Centro Histórico hotels", reason: "The Zócalo is worth a day trip, not a home base. The area is chaotic, shuts down early, and you'll feel disconnected from modern CDMX." },
    { name: "Zona Rosa", reason: "Dated, touristy, and trying too hard. The neighborhoods around it (Roma, Juárez) absorbed anything good that was here." },
    { name: "Santa Fe business district", reason: "Corporate campus energy with nothing to walk to. You'll need a car for everything and miss why people love this city." }
