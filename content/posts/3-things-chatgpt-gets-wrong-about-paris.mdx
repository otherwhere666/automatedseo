faqs:
  - question: "Why are ChatGPT's Paris hotel prices so inaccurate?"
    answer: "ChatGPT's training data has a knowledge cutoff, so it quotes 2021-2022 prices. Mid-range hotels it claims cost €150-250 now start at €320 in central neighborhoods like Saint-Germain and Le Marais."
  - question: "What makes a restaurant recommendation outdated?"
    answer: "Places like L'Ami Jean and Le Comptoir du Relais have been on tourist lists for 15+ years. ChatGPT doesn't know about recent closures, new reservation policies, or that these spots now have 90-minute waits filled with tourists."
  - question: "Can ChatGPT actually book my Paris trip?"
    answer: "No. ChatGPT can only suggest ideas but cannot check real availability, compare live prices, or make actual reservations. You'll need to handle all bookings separately."
  - question: "How much do Paris hotels actually cost now?"
    answer: "Decent hotels in central arrondissements start at €320+ per night. During events like Fashion Week or December Christmas markets, rates can triple to €600-900 per night."

ChatGPT will enthusiastically help you plan a Paris trip, rattling off the Eiffel Tower and suggesting you "try the croissants." But here's the problem: it's working with outdated information, can't access real prices, and leaves you to figure out the actual booking yourself. After helping thousands of travelers navigate Paris, I've noticed three consistent blind spots where general AI falls short—and why purpose-built travel intelligence makes all the difference.

## It quotes hotel prices from 2021 (or makes them up entirely)

Ask ChatGPT about Paris hotel costs and you'll get confident responses about "mid-range hotels running €150-250 per night." Sounds reasonable until you discover that Hotel des Grands Boulevards in the 2nd arrondissement now starts at €380, and anything under €200 places you in Belleville hostels or sketchy locations near Gare du Nord.

I watched this play out with a client last month. She'd budgeted €180 per night based on ChatGPT's guidance for Saint-Germain, then panicked when Hotel Bonaparte showed €420 and Hotel des Marronniers was €395 for her October dates. The disconnect isn't malicious—ChatGPT's training data has a knowledge cutoff, and Paris hotel prices have shifted dramatically post-pandemic.

> "ChatGPT gives you the confidence of specific prices without the inconvenience of accuracy."

Real-time pricing matters enormously in Paris. Summer rates at Hotel Costes jump from €450 to €850 during Fashion Week. Christmas markets drive December prices at Hotel des Invalides from €280 to €620. Even shoulder season varies wildly—October 2024 was 40% more expensive than October 2023 due to overlapping tech conferences at Palais des Congrès.

When Otherwhere searches Paris hotels, we're pulling live inventory through the same APIs that Hotel Plaza Athénée and Le Bristol use. You see actual availability and current rates at properties like Hotel Malte Opera (currently €295/night) versus algorithmic guesses. We can also hold your selection for 30 minutes while you decide—something ChatGPT definitely can't do.

## Its restaurant recommendations feel like a 2019 listicle

ChatGPT loves suggesting L'Ami Jean and Le Comptoir du Relais for "authentic Parisian bistros." Both are fine restaurants, but they've been on every English-language "best of Paris" list for fifteen years. You'll wait 90 minutes for a table at L'Ami Jean surrounded entirely by other tourists following the same AI advice.

The real issue is that ChatGPT can't learn from recent experiences or adapt recommendations based on current conditions. It doesn't know that L'As du Fallafel has become a victim of its own success, with hour-long queues that kill the casual charm. It can't tell you that Pierre Hermé's Saint-Sulpice location closed in 2023, or that Le Mary Celeste in the 4th now requires reservations three weeks in advance.

Great Paris dining is about timing and context. Breizh Café in the 3rd is perfect for a rainy Tuesday lunch but chaos on Saturday night. That wine bar Septime la Cave has probably been discovered if it's in ChatGPT's training data from 2022.

> "AI that can't update its opinions is doomed to give yesterday's advice for tomorrow's trip."

Local knowledge evolves constantly. The best Paris restaurants change seasonally—Clown Bar shifts its menu monthly, neighborhoods like Pigalle transform character, and what worked at Du Pain et des Idées pre-pandemic doesn't always translate. I rely on current intel from people actually eating their way through the 10th and 11th arrondissements right now, not training data from years past.

## It stops at suggestions instead of solutions

Here's ChatGPT's biggest limitation for travel: it's a brainstorming buddy, not a booking agent. It'll generate elaborate Paris itineraries featuring Musée d'Orsay and dinner in Saint-Germain but can't reserve a single hotel room, check Air France availability, or handle the dozen small decisions that turn ideas into confirmed plans.

This creates what I call "planning paralysis." You get excited about AI-generated suggestions, then face the overwhelming task of researching actual availability, comparing prices across Booking.com and Hotels.com, and coordinating timing. Many travelers end up bookmarking Hotel Jeanne d'Arc and Hotel Saint-Paul without booking anything.

The gap becomes obvious when you need to make trade-offs. Should you stay at Hotel National Des Arts et Métiers in Marais at €380/night or Hotel Mercure Montparnasse at €240? ChatGPT can't tell you that the Marais hotel is fully booked anyway, or that the Montparnasse option has no availability for your checkout date. It definitely can't hold both options while you decide, then handle the actual booking process.

> "The distance between a great recommendation and a confirmed reservation is where most travel plans die."

Otherwhere bridges this gap by moving from suggestion to solution. We search real inventory at properties like Hotel des Grands Boulevards and Hotel Malte Opera, present viable options with current pricing, and handle the entire booking process once you decide. You get confirmation numbers, e-tickets, and hotel vouchers—not just inspiration.

We also respect your existing loyalty programs and preferences. If you're Marriott Platinum, we'll prioritize Le Metropolitan or Prince de Galles where that status gets you suite upgrades. If you hate connecting flights, we'll focus on direct Air France or Delta routes from JFK even if they cost €150 more.

## Why purpose-built travel AI matters

General AI like ChatGPT excels at creative brainstorming and broad research. But travel planning requires specialized capabilities: real-time pricing, current availability, actual booking systems, and the ability to adapt recommendations based on live conditions.

The best Paris trip isn't just about knowing the right places—it's about knowing which places are available when you need them, at prices that fit your budget, with the ability to secure them before they disappear.

That's where dedicated travel intelligence like Otherwhere makes the difference. We combine the creative problem-solving of AI with real booking power and current market data. You get both the inspiration and the execution.
