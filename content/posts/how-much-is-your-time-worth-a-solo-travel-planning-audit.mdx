faqs:
  - question: "How much time does the average person spend planning a trip?"
    answer: "McKinsey research shows consumers spend 5.5 hours researching leisure trips and 2.8 hours for business travel, not including booking time and modifications."
  - question: "At what income level does hiring travel planning make financial sense?"
    answer: "If you earn $120,000+ annually (roughly $58/hour), and spend 3+ hours planning trips, you're looking at $175+ in opportunity cost per trip—often more than professional planning fees."
  - question: "What specific mistakes do DIY planners commonly make?"
    answer: "Booking flights with excessive layovers to save $100, choosing hotels in inconvenient locations that require expensive taxis, and missing fare class differences that affect upgrades and changes."
  - question: "How does professional travel planning differ from using booking sites?"
    answer: "Professional planners access live inventory systems, understand routing nuances, can hold reservations while you decide, and apply expertise from thousands of bookings to avoid common pitfalls."

Here's an uncomfortable truth: If you're earning $150,000+ annually, every hour you spend researching flights and hotels costs you more than you'll ever save. The average solo traveler spends 3.2 hours planning a single trip, comparing dozens of options across multiple sites. At $75+ per hour of your time, that "budget" flight just became very expensive.

## The true cost of DIY travel planning

Let's be honest about what travel planning actually involves. You start with a simple Google search for flights to Barcelona. Two hours later, you're deep in a Reddit thread about whether Terminal 2E at Charles de Gaulle is actually as chaotic as travelers claim, with seventeen browser tabs open and zero bookings made.

I tracked my own planning process for a recent London trip—what I thought would be a quick 30-minute search:

- **Flight research**: 45 minutes across Kayak, Google Flights, and British Airways direct
- **Hotel comparison**: 1.5 hours on Booking.com, comparing the Zetter Townhouse in Fitzrovia versus Premier Inn London County Hall, reading 200+ reviews, checking walking distances to Borough Market on Google Maps
- **Route optimization**: 20 minutes deciding between Heathrow (Piccadilly Line direct) versus Gatwick (Express train plus Tube transfer)
- **Second-guessing**: Another 40 minutes the next day, convinced Virgin Atlantic had better redemption rates than what I found

Total time: 3 hours and 35 minutes. For a straightforward round-trip flight and three nights in Zone 1.

> "At $100 per hour of your time, that $200 'savings' on flights just cost you $360 in opportunity cost."

## The psychology of sunk cost in travel research

Here's where it gets worse. Once you've invested an hour in research, you feel compelled to keep going. Maybe there's a better deal on page 7 of Kayak results. Maybe that Marriott with 4.2 stars is actually superior to the 4.4-star Hilton because reviewers mention the Executive Lounge stays open until midnight.

This is sunk cost fallacy in action, and the travel industry has weaponized it perfectly. Those "23 people are looking at this hotel" notifications on Booking.com? The constantly changing prices that make you refresh Expedia obsessively? It's all designed to keep you searching longer.

A McKinsey study found that consumers spend an average of 5.5 hours researching a leisure trip. For business travelers, it's still 2.8 hours—even when someone else is paying.

## What your time is actually worth

If you're earning $120,000 annually, your working time is worth roughly $58 per hour. But here's the thing—your personal time is worth more than your working time, not less. When you're planning travel on a Saturday morning instead of going to brunch at Republique or sleeping in, you're trading premium time for research that could be done by someone else.

Let's run the numbers on a typical international trip:

- **Initial research**: 2 hours
- **Booking process**: 45 minutes (creating Marriott Bonvoy accounts, entering Amex details, confirming seat assignments)
- **Re-checking and modifications**: 1 hour (because you absolutely will)
- **Dealing with issues**: 30 minutes average per trip

At $75 per hour of personal time value, that's $318 you've "spent" on planning.

## The expertise gap

Beyond time, there's the expertise factor. I've watched friends book "amazing deals" on United flights with 14-hour layovers in Dubai, or hotels that looked charming online but turned out to be next to construction for the Elizabeth Line extension.

Professional travel planning isn't just about finding flights—it's about understanding that Lufthansa's Frankfurt hub has better on-time performance than their Munich connections, or recognizing when a "4-star" hotel near Rome's Termini Station actually means "3-star with delusions and a 15-minute walk through sketchy streets at night."

When Otherwhere sources options for clients, we're not just searching the same Expedia and Priceline sites you have access to. We're working with live inventory systems, understanding that Delta One suites vary dramatically between the A330-900neo and older A330-300 aircraft, and applying knowledge from thousands of bookings. We know that British Airways' Club World is wildly inconsistent depending on whether you get the refurbished cabin, or that certain Marriott properties in Bangkok consistently over-promise and under-deliver despite gleaming photos.

## The real cost of travel mistakes

Bad planning doesn't just waste time—it ruins trips. That cheaper 6 AM departure from LAX means a 4 AM alarm and arriving in London exhausted at 11 PM local time. The hotel that saved you $80 per night but sits in Paddington instead of Covent Garden costs you hours and energy navigating the Tube twice daily.

I once saved $300 on a Rome hotel by booking the Artemide near Termini instead of something in Trastevere. The "10-minute walk to the Colosseum" turned into a 20-minute trek through unremarkable via Nazionale twice daily. By day three, I was taking €15 taxis everywhere, spending more than I'd saved plus losing time I'd rather have spent wandering the Ponte district.

Consider the downstream costs of suboptimal planning:

- **Transportation**: That Paddington hotel requires £12 Uber rides or 25-minute Tube journeys to reach Westminster
- **Meals**: Poor location in Rome means €40 hotel breakfast or time spent finding decent cacio e pepe away from tourist traps  
- **Energy**: Complicated connections through Frankfurt and poor hotel choices drain your vacation stamina
- **Opportunity**: Hours spent dealing with Ryanair flight changes are hours not spent at the Uffizi

## When delegation makes sense

The math is straightforward. If your time is worth $75+ per hour and you typically spend 3+ hours planning trips, you're looking at $225+ in opportunity cost per trip. Quality travel planning services typically add 10-15% to your total trip cost, but they also ensure you're making optimal choices based on actual expertise.

With Otherwhere, you text exactly what you want—"4 nights Tokyo, good sushi access, under $4K total"—and we handle everything else. We search live inventory, present you with 3-5 curated options showing real prices for the Park Hyatt Tokyo versus Aman Tokyo versus boutique alternatives, and once you choose, we handle the entire booking process. You get confirmation numbers, airline PNRs, and mobile boarding passes without touching Expedia.

We can even hold American Airlines flights for up to 30 minutes while you decide—try doing that on Kayak.

## The luxury of saying no

The most successful people I know have learned to identify tasks that are below their hourly rate and delegate them ruthlessly. They don't research their own flights for the same reason they don't detail their own Tesla Model S or prepare their own taxes—it's not the best use of their time.

This isn't about being too important for research. It's about being honest about what your time is worth and making decisions accordingly. If you're earning $200K+, spending Saturday morning comparing Delta versus American flight options is a $100+ per hour activity that someone else can do better and faster.

The goal isn't to spend more money. It's to spend money more intentionally, in ways that buy back your most valuable resource: time.
