faqs:
  - question: "Can ChatGPT book flights and hotels directly?"
    answer: "No, ChatGPT cannot access real-time pricing or make actual bookings. It can only provide general recommendations without current availability or accurate pricing."
  - question: "How accurate are ChatGPT's travel price estimates?"
    answer: "ChatGPT's price estimates can be significantly off. In my experience, flight estimates were $200-300 lower than actual prices, and hotel rates were often 40-60% higher than suggested."
  - question: "What's the main limitation of using ChatGPT for travel planning?"
    answer: "The biggest issue is the gap between inspiration and execution. ChatGPT excels at creating itineraries but cannot verify availability, provide real-time pricing, or handle bookings."
  - question: "How long does manual booking take after ChatGPT planning?"
    answer: "What should be a 10-minute process can stretch into 3-4 hours of cross-referencing prices, checking availability, and verifying details across multiple booking sites."
  - question: "Are there better alternatives to ChatGPT for travel booking?"
    answer: "Yes, purpose-built travel services like Otherwhere can provide real-time pricing, actual availability, and handle the complete booking process from recommendation to confirmation."

ChatGPT excels at travel inspiration—it crafted a detailed Mexico City itinerary in minutes, complete with specific galleries in Roma Norte and restaurant recommendations like Pujol and Quintonil. But when I tried to actually book the trip, the limitations became glaringly obvious. No real prices, no availability checks, and certainly no booking capability. What started as an exciting planning session quickly devolved into hours of manual research across Expedia, Booking.com, and direct hotel websites.

Here's the play-by-play of my ChatGPT Mexico adventure, and why I eventually needed a different approach altogether.

## The honeymoon phase: ChatGPT's travel brilliance

I'll give credit where it's due—ChatGPT's initial travel brainstorming felt magical. I asked for a 5-day Mexico City itinerary focusing on contemporary art and authentic food experiences, avoiding Frida Kahlo House and other tourist magnets.

Within 30 seconds, I had a beautifully structured plan. Day one: Museo Jumex in Nuevo Polanco and lunch at Pujol (with a note about booking three months ahead). Day two: Gallery hopping along Colima Street in Roma Norte and street tacos at Tacos El Vilsito in Doctores. Day three: Xochimilco floating gardens via Uber and dinner at Quintonil in Polanco.

The recommendations felt considered, not generic. ChatGPT suggested staying in Roma Norte for walkability to Condesa, recommended specific mezcal bars like Licoreria Limantour, and even included Metro Line 1 transportation notes between neighborhoods.

> "ChatGPT's travel inspiration feels like having a well-traveled friend who's read every guidebook—until you need them to actually make a reservation."

For pure ideation, ChatGPT delivered exactly what I wanted. The problem started when inspiration met reality.

## Where the magic breaks down

"Great," I thought, "now book me flights from LAX to Mexico City for March 15-20."

ChatGPT politely explained it couldn't access real-time flight data or make bookings. Fair enough—I knew this going in. But then I asked for specific flight recommendations with airlines and approximate prices.

The response was frustratingly vague: "Aeromexico and Delta typically offer direct flights around $400-600." When I checked actual availability, March 15th flights were $847 on Delta, $923 on Aeromexico, with the cheapest option being a Volaris red-eye for $634.

Hotel recommendations proved equally problematic. ChatGPT suggested "Hotel Carlota in Roma Norte, typically $150-200 per night." Reality check: Hotel Carlota was booked solid for my dates, and comparable Roma Norte hotels like Casa Comtesse and Ignacia Guest House ranged from $280-450 per night.

The disconnect between ChatGPT's confident suggestions and actual availability was jarring. I spent three hours cross-referencing recommendations, checking dates, and starting over when options weren't available.

## The manual booking marathon

Armed with ChatGPT's itinerary framework, I began the tedious process of manual booking. This meant:

- Checking flight prices across Kayak, Google Flights, Expedia, Momondo, and Skyscanner
- Cross-referencing hotel availability on Booking.com and Hotels.com while reading TripAdvisor reviews from the past six months
- Calling Pujol directly at +52 55 5545 4111 because their online reservation system was entirely in Spanish
- Using Google Maps to verify actual walking distances between ChatGPT's suggested locations (the Museo Jumex to Pujol walk was 45 minutes, not 15)

What ChatGPT estimated as a 10-minute planning session stretched into an entire afternoon. The cognitive load of juggling twelve browser tabs, comparing prices across platforms, and verifying details was exhausting.

> "The gap between AI inspiration and actual booking feels like being handed a beautiful recipe, then realizing you have to grow the ingredients yourself."

Worse, I kept second-guessing ChatGPT's suggestions once I saw real prices and availability. Was Casa Malí a better hotel option in my $300/night budget? Were there flights with better timing that ChatGPT couldn't see? Should I consider Airbnb alternatives in Condesa instead?

## The memory problem

Here's where ChatGPT's limitations became most apparent: it couldn't remember my preferences or learn from previous conversations. Every new session meant re-explaining my $2,000 total budget, preference for boutique hotels, and 6 AM flight constraints.

When I asked for alternative restaurant suggestions after discovering Quintonil was booked, ChatGPT had no memory of my earlier conversation about preferring contemporary Mexican cuisine over traditional options. I had to rebuild context each time, re-explaining my interest in chef Enrique Olvera's modern approach versus street food.

This is particularly frustrating for complex trips where preferences evolve through the planning process. Real travel agents remember that you prefer aisle seats, dislike early morning flights, and have a Marriott Bonvoy account to consider.

## What purpose-built travel AI gets right

After my ChatGPT experiment, I decided to try Otherwhere—a service specifically designed for travel booking, not just planning. The difference was immediately obvious.

Instead of general recommendations, I received three specific flight options: Delta nonstop for $847 departing 11:15 AM, Aeromexico direct for $923 at 2:30 PM, and Volaris for $634 with a 6:45 AM departure. Each option included total travel time, two free checked bags policies, and seat selection details. No more guessing about actual costs or availability.

The hotel suggestions came with current rates for my exact March dates: Hotel Nima for $285/night with rooftop terrace, La Valise for $340/night with kitchenette, and Hippodrome Hotel for $195/night near Parque México. Each included recent guest reviews and walking distances to my planned gallery locations.

> "The difference between general AI and travel-specific AI is like the difference between reading about swimming and jumping in the pool."

Most importantly, everything was actually bookable. No gap between recommendation and reality—just curated options I could act on immediately.

## The booking experience that actually works

What impressed me most was the end-to-end service approach. Rather than generating a list and leaving me to figure out logistics, Otherwhere handled the actual booking process through their text interface.

I selected the Delta 11:15 AM flight and Hotel Nima via text message. Within 20 minutes, I received Delta confirmation PNR code, e-tickets sent to my email, and hotel voucher with check-in details. The service even held my flight selection for 30 minutes while I decided—something impossible with Expedia or direct airline booking.

The pricing transparency was refreshing too. No hidden $75 booking fees or resort charges discovered at checkout. The quoted $847 flight price and $285/night hotel rate was exactly what appeared on my credit card statement.

## The verdict: Right tool for the right job

ChatGPT remains excellent for travel inspiration and initial brainstorming. Its ability to synthesize information and suggest creative itineraries like "contemporary art galleries within walking distance of mezcal bars" is genuinely impressive. But inspiration without execution feels incomplete.

For actual trip planning—the messy reality of availability, pricing, and booking—purpose-built travel tools prove far more effective. The difference is like having a knowledgeable friend versus having a knowledgeable friend who can also make things happen.

My Mexico City trip was fantastic, by the way. The Museo Tamayo's current exhibition exceeded expectations, and I discovered incredible mezcal at Baltra Bar in Roma Norte. But the planning process taught me an important lesson about matching tools to tasks.
