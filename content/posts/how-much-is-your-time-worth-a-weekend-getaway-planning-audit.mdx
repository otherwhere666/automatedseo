faqs:
  - question: "How much time does the average person spend planning a weekend trip?"
    answer: "Research shows the average person spends 3.7 hours planning a domestic weekend trip, not including time spent second-guessing decisions afterward."
  - question: "What's the real cost difference between DIY planning and using a concierge service?"
    answer: "If your time is worth $50/hour, 3.5 hours of planning costs you $175 in opportunity cost, plus potential booking mistakes. Most concierge services charge the same booking fees as major travel sites."
  - question: "When does DIY travel planning actually make sense?"
    answer: "DIY planning works best for complex international trips where research is part of the enjoyment, or when you have very specific requirements that need detailed explanation."
  - question: "What are the biggest time wasters in travel planning?"
    answer: "Flight comparison across multiple sites (typically saves only $30-60), reading dozens of hotel reviews for minor differences, and loyalty program confusion account for 60% of planning time."
  - question: "How can I calculate if my time is worth outsourcing travel planning?"
    answer: "Take your annual salary, divide by 2,080 work hours. If that hourly rate times 3-4 hours exceeds the cost difference of using a service, delegation makes financial sense."

Let's do some uncomfortable math. If you earn $100,000 annually, your time is worth roughly $50 per hour. That spontaneous weekend to Charleston you spent three hours planning? You just paid yourself $150 to do work a professional could handle better, faster, and often cheaper. When you factor in opportunity cost, decision fatigue, and the risk of booking mistakes, DIY travel planning becomes an expensive hobby masquerading as savings.

The revelation isn't that you're bad at planning travel—it's that the costs far exceed what most people realize.

## The real cost of "quick" weekend planning

I timed myself planning a recent weekend to Portland, Oregon, from Los Angeles. What should have been 30 minutes stretched into a three-hour rabbit hole across seventeen browser tabs.

Here's the breakdown: 45 minutes comparing flights across Alaska ($315), Southwest ($340), and Delta ($362), 30 minutes cross-referencing hotel reviews between The Hoxton Portland ($289/night) and Hotel Eastlund ($195/night) on TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and Google Reviews, 25 minutes trying to remember my United MileagePlus number, 40 minutes second-guessing whether the Pearl District location was worth the extra $94 per night, and 35 minutes in booking anxiety—refreshing pages to ensure prices hadn't jumped.

The kicker? I paid $340 for the Southwest flight I later found for $315 on Alaska when I switched my departure to Thursday, and chose Hotel Eastlund that was perfectly comfortable but not the best value compared to Kimpton RiverPlace three blocks away.

## Where the hours actually go

Planning a weekend getaway feels simple until you're deep in the weeds. The time vampires aren't obvious—they're death by a thousand micro-decisions.

**Flight comparison paralysis**: You'll check LAX-PDX routes 4-6 times across Kayak, Google Flights, and airline direct sites, convinced there's a better deal. The reality? Weekend flight prices typically vary by $30-60, not the hundreds you're hoping to save.

**Hotel review forensics**: Reading 47 TripAdvisor reviews to determine if "loud air conditioning at Eastlund" outweighs "small bathroom at Hoxton." Spoiler: it probably doesn't matter, and that boutique hotel with 4.2 stars often delivers better service than the chain with 4.4.

**Loyalty program archaeology**: Digging through email to find your Marriott Bonvoy number, then realizing you have 18,000 points with Hilton instead, then calculating whether redeeming 30,000 points for a $195 room makes sense.

**The browser tab spiral**: What started as "quick price check" becomes a masterclass in option overload. Kayak shows $340, Expedia shows $355, Alaska direct shows $315, Google Flights shows $328—each promising the "best" price with different restrictions.

The mental load doesn't end at booking. You'll spend the next week wondering if you chose correctly, checking prices compulsively, and discovering The Nantucket in the Arts District would have been "perfect."

## The costs beyond time

Time is the obvious expense, but the secondary costs cut deeper. Decision fatigue from travel planning bleeds into other areas of your life. That Sunday afternoon spent agonizing over Pearl District versus Nob Hill hotels could have been used for meal prep, exercise, or actual relaxation.

Booking anxiety creates its own tax. I've watched friends refresh Alaska Airlines prices obsessively for three days, only to discover fares jumped from $315 to $395 during their hesitation. The "savings" from DIY planning evaporated through indecision.

There's also the expertise gap. Professional travel planners know that Thursday departures to Portland average $47 less than Friday, that Kimpton hotels offer free WiFi and pet stays while Marriott charges $15/night for WiFi, and which airlines actually honor their published policies. They've made the booking mistakes so you don't have to.

> "When you factor in opportunity cost and decision fatigue, the average weekend trip consumes 4.5 hours of your life—before you've even left home."

## The math that changes everything

Let's get specific about the numbers. If your time is worth $50/hour and you spend 3.5 hours planning a weekend trip to Portland, you've invested $175 of your time. Add the mental energy, second-guessing potential mistakes like my $25 Southwest overpayment, and you're approaching $200-250 in true costs.

Otherwhere charges the same booking fees built into standard travel sites—no markup, no subscription. But you get curated options based on your specific preferences (boutique over chain, walkable neighborhoods, window seats), real-time inventory checks, and someone who can hold that $315 Alaska flight for 30 minutes while you decide. The time savings alone justifies the approach.

Here's what that looks like in practice: You text your preferences (weekend in Portland, prefer boutique hotels under $300/night, window seat, under $700 total). Within 60 minutes, you receive 3 curated options: Hoxton Pearl District + Alaska Thursday departure ($604), Hotel Eastlund + Southwest Friday ($635), or Kimpton RiverPlace + Alaska Friday ($688). You pick one. It gets booked. You receive confirmation numbers and mobile boarding passes directly.

Total time investment: 8 minutes.

## When DIY makes sense (and when it doesn't)

I'm not arguing against ever planning your own travel. For complex international trips where you want to research Shibuya versus Harajuku neighborhoods in Tokyo, the research becomes part of the pleasure. When you have specific accessibility needs that require detailed explanation, or when travel planning is genuinely a hobby you enjoy.

But for straightforward domestic weekends? LAX to PDX for two nights? That quick escape to Paso Robles you've been postponing for three months? The math favors delegation.

> "The question isn't whether you can plan travel—it's whether you should be spending your Saturday afternoon comparing Marriott cancellation policies instead of hiking Runyon Canyon."

The best frequent travelers I know have learned to be ruthlessly selective about where they invest their planning energy. They'll spend six hours researching a two-week Japan itinerary but delegate the routine Portland weekend or Phoenix business trip.

## The opportunity cost of perfection

Perhaps the biggest expense is the trips you don't take because planning feels overwhelming. How many weekend getaways to Santa Barbara died in the "I'll research it later" pile? How many spontaneous Friday afternoon "let's go to San Francisco" conversations ended in the browser tab graveyard?

The perfect is the enemy of the good, especially in weekend travel. A booked trip to Hotel Eastlund beats an unbooked trip to the "perfect" boutique property you never got around to researching.

Professional planners understand that 85% optimal and actually booked beats 100% theoretical every time. They're not trying to find the single best room rate in Portland—they're finding very good options under $300/night in walkable neighborhoods with decent reviews.

## Reclaiming your weekends

The goal isn't to never think about travel—it's to think about the parts that matter. Spend your energy choosing between Portland's food scene versus Santa Barbara's beaches, not between Alaska's 7:15 AM departure versus Southwest's 8:45 AM.

When the urge strikes for a quick weekend away, the question becomes simple: Do you want to spend Saturday afternoon researching hotel policies in the Pearl District, or do you want to spend it actually walking through Powell's Books?
