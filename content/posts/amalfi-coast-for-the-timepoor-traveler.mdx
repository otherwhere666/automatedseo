faqs:
  - question: "Which town should I base myself in for a 3-day Amalfi Coast trip?"
    answer: "Positano for first-time visitors and Instagram moments (€400+/night), Ravello for sophistication and better value (€280/night at Hotel Villa Maria), or Amalfi town for authenticity and ferry access (€180/night at Le Arcate)."
  - question: "How much should I budget for a private boat tour?"
    answer: "Lucibello in Amalfi charges €200 per person for 4-hour trips (minimum 4 people), including prosecco and limoncello. Public ferries cost €8-20 but have crowds and fixed schedules."
  - question: "Is the Path of the Gods hike worth it for short-trip visitors?"
    answer: "Yes, if you start at 8am from Bomerano. The 7.8km trail to Nocelle takes 3-4 hours and offers the coast's most spectacular views. Moderate difficulty, ends with bus access back to Positano."
  - question: "When is the best time to visit to avoid crowds but keep good weather?"
    answer: "Late April through early May or September through October. Summer crowds are overwhelming, August is too hot for hiking, and you'll get perfect weather plus open restaurants in shoulder season."
  - question: "Should I rent a car or use other transport on the Amalfi Coast?"
    answer: "Rent a scooter (€30/day) instead of a car. The SS163 coastal road is narrow with impossible parking. Scooters let you enjoy the scenery rather than stress about oncoming buses on hairpin turns."

The Amalfi Coast doesn't need two weeks. You need three focused days, the right base, and zero time wasted on tourist traps. Choose Positano for postcard perfection, Ravello for serene sophistication, or Amalfi town for authentic grit. Skip the multi-town hotel hopping that Instagram influencers push—it's a recipe for spending more time in transit than enjoying limoncello at sunset.

Here's how to nail Italy's most photogenic coastline when every day counts.

## Pick your power base (and stick to it)

The biggest mistake time-poor travelers make? Trying to stay in multiple towns. The coastal road (SS163) takes 45 minutes minimum between major towns during peak season. You'll spend your precious vacation time playing luggage Tetris instead of sipping Falanghina overlooking the Med.

**Positano** is the obvious choice for first-timers. Yes, it's touristy. Yes, Hotel Le Sirenuse starts at €800/night and Hotel Poseidon runs €400/night for sea views. But there's a reason every travel magazine uses it as their cover shot. The town tumbles down the cliffside like a watercolor painting, and you can walk from Spiaggia Grande to the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta in 15 minutes.

> "Positano bites deep. It is a dream place that isn't quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone." —John Steinbeck wasn't wrong.

**Ravello** appeals to travelers who've outgrown the need to photograph their pasta. Perched 365 meters above sea level, it's where Gore Vidal chose to live and where Wagner composed parts of Parsifal. The Villa Cimbrone gardens offer the coast's most spectacular views without the Positano crowds. Hotel Villa Maria runs €280/night versus Positano's €500+ for comparable luxury, while Palazzo Avino commands €450/night for five-star service.

**Amalfi town** gets overlooked, which is exactly why you should consider it. The largest of the coast towns, it has the best restaurant selection, actual locals, and ferry connections to Capri that don't require a pilgrimage down Positano's 300 stairs. Le Arcate hotel sits right on the harbor for €180/night—a third of what you'd pay for a sea view in Positano. Hotel Santa Caterina offers luxury at €320/night, still half of Positano's premium properties.

## The 72-hour hit list

### Day one: Master your micro-geography

Forget the coastal drive on arrival day. You're jet-lagged and the roads are genuinely terrifying when you're not alert. Instead, explore your chosen town on foot and get the lay of the land.

**If you're in Positano:** Take the local SITA bus up to Nocelle (€2, runs every 30 minutes from Via Cristoforo Colombo). This tiny village gives you the classic postcard shot of Positano from above, minus the crowds at Villa San Michele. Walk back down via the ancient mule path Sentiero per Nocelle (45 minutes, moderate difficulty) and reward yourself with aperitivo at Franco's Bar on Via Pasitea—their terrace has sunset views for €12 Negronis instead of €25 at hotel bars.

**If you chose Ravello:** Villa Cimbrone at golden hour is mandatory. Pay the €7 garden entrance fee and head straight to the Terrazza dell'Infinito. Gore Vidal called it "the most beautiful view in the world," and that was before everyone had Instagram FOMO. Book dinner at Rossellinis (2 Michelin stars, €180 tasting menu) if you want to blow the budget properly, or grab pizza at Villa Maria's terrace restaurant for €18 and similar views.

**Amalfi town strategists:** Climb to the Valle delle Ferriere nature reserve via Via delle Cartiere. The 4km hike takes you past abandoned paper mills from the 13th century to Cascata della Ferriera waterfall that most tourists never see. It's free entry, no crowds, and you'll spot wild orchids and woodpeckers that somehow thrive 20 minutes from the coastal chaos.

### Day two: The boat imperative

This is non-negotiable. The Amalfi Coast exists because of the sea, and you haven't really seen it until you've viewed those cliffs from water level.

Skip the crowded Alilauro ferries to Capri (€20 each way plus crowds) and book a private boat instead. Lucibello in Amalfi runs 4-hour trips for €200 per person (minimum 4 people) that hit Grotta dello Smeraldo and Fiordo di Furore swimming caves. They provide Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG, local Limoncello del Convento, and most importantly, a captain who knows where to anchor for photos without tourist hordes in the background.

> "The Mediterranean has the color of mackerel, changeable I mean. You don't always know if it is green or violet, you can't even say it's blue, because the next moment the changing reflection has taken on a tint of rose or gray." —Van Gogh painted elsewhere, but he'd have understood this coastline.

If private boats aren't in budget, at minimum take the Cooperativa Sant'Andrea ferry from Positano to Amalfi (€8, 35 minutes, runs April-October). You get the cliff perspective and skip the hairpin turns that leave half of rental car passengers carsick.

### Day three: Go inland or go deeper

Most visitors never leave the coastal road. That's their loss and your opportunity.

**Option A: The lemon experience** — Head to Sfusato Amalfitano lemon groves above Amalfi town via Via delle Cartiere. These aren't regular lemons—they're football-sized, sweet enough to eat like oranges, and protected by UNESCO since 1997. Azienda Agricola Aceto runs 2-hour tours (€35) that include limoncello tasting made from 80-year-old trees and lunch on their pergola terrace. You'll understand why locals guard these hand-built stone terraces so fiercely.

**Option B: Ravello's villa circuit** — If you based yourself elsewhere, day three is your Ravello day. Villa Rufolo (€7 entry, famous for Wagner's Klingsor garden inspiration) and Villa Cimbrone (€7) are both mandatory, but time it right. Villa Rufolo opens at 9am and most tour buses don't arrive until 11am. You get those famous gardens and the belvedere overlooking Minori in near-solitude for two blissful hours.

**Option C: The Path of the Gods** — Sentiero degli Dei is the coast's most famous hike, and for good reason. The 7.8km trail from Bomerano to Nocelle offers views that make the Positano tourism hordes suddenly make sense. Start early (8am bus from Amalfi to Agerola, then taxi to Bomerano trailhead) to avoid both heat and crowds. It's moderate difficulty with 200m elevation gain but absolutely doable for anyone who can handle stairs. The trail ends in Nocelle, where SITA bus 5070 runs back to Positano every 40 minutes.

## Where to eat (the short list)

Forget the 47-restaurant roundups. Here are the three meals that matter:

**La Sponda at Le Sirenuse** (Positano) for the blowout dinner. Chef Matteo Temperini's tasting menu runs €180 per person minimum. Yes, it's worth it. The dining room is lit entirely by 400 candles, the service is flawless, and the Campanian seafood actually lives up to the setting. Book 2-3 weeks ahead through their concierge.

**Da Adolfo** (Positano beach, Spiaggia di Laurito) for lunch with your toes in the sand. Take the free boat shuttle from Spiaggia Grande (look for the red fish flag, runs 10am-sunset). Their mozzarella di bufala comes from Caserta province, the branzino is line-caught daily by local fishermen, and a full meal of grilled fish, wine, and limoncello runs €25. Cash only, no reservations, perfect chaos.

**Mamma Agata** (Ravello, Via San Cosma 9) for the cooking class you'll actually remember. Agata Parets taught Sofia Loren to cook and has been running classes from her hillside kitchen for 30 years. €85 gets you 4 hours, three-course lunch, Falanghina wine, and handwritten recipe cards for her legendary lemon delight that you'll use for decades.

## The logistics that matter

**Getting there:** Naples Capodichino Airport to Amalfi Coast is 90 minutes by car, 2+ hours by Curreri bus to SITA connection. If you're truly time-poor, book a private transfer with Amalfi Limo Service (€100-120) and use the drive to plan your days rather than wrestling with train schedules while jet-lagged.

**Getting around:** Rent a scooter from Positano Rent (€30/day for Piaggio Liberty 125cc), not a car. The coastal road wasn't designed for two-way traffic, much less parking. Scooter rental gives you access to tiny parking spots in Atrani and lets you actually enjoy the scenery instead of white-knuckling every turn around tour buses.

**When to go:** Late April-early May or September-October. Summer crowds are genuinely overwhelming—Positano's population swells from 4,000 to 12,000 daily—and August heat makes hiking miserable. Shoulder season gives you perfect 22°C weather, open restaurants, and the space to actually experience why this coast is legendary.

> "The Amalfi Coast rewards the decisive traveler. Pick your battles, choose your indulgences, and leave the completionist mentality at home."

This isn't about seeing everything—it's about experiencing the essential. The coast's magic isn't in checking boxes; it's in those unplanned moments when the afternoon light hits the water just right and you understand why people have been falling in love with this coastline for centuries.
