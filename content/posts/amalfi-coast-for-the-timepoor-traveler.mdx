faqs:
  - question: "How many days do I need for the Amalfi Coast?"
    answer: "72 hours is sufficient if you choose one strategic base rather than trying to cover every town. Stay in Positano, Amalfi town, or Ravello and explore deeply rather than superficially."
  - question: "What's the best base for a short Amalfi Coast trip?"
    answer: "Amalfi town offers the best ferry connections (boats to Capri every 90 minutes) and bus terminal access to Ravello, while maintaining authentic charm without Positano's crowds."
  - question: "When should I avoid visiting the Amalfi Coast?"
    answer: "July-August brings cruise ship crowds, 40% higher hotel rates, and temperatures above 85°F. Easter week and Italian holidays in August create traffic nightmares on the narrow coastal road."
  - question: "Do I need a car on the Amalfi Coast?"
    answer: "No. The SS163 coastal road is only 18 feet wide with tour buses, and parking in Positano costs €5/hour when available. SITA buses connect major towns every 30 minutes for €1.30-2.40 per ride."
  - question: "How much should I budget for 3 days on the Amalfi Coast?"
    answer: "Expect €300-800/night for quality hotels, €60-180 for dinner for two, and €400 for a 4-hour private boat tour. Total budget ranges from €1,200-3,000 for a couple depending on accommodation choices."

The Amalfi Coast doesn't require two weeks to enchant you—it needs strategic positioning. With only 72 hours, skip the village-hopping madness that leaves you exhausted in traffic. Instead, plant yourself in one of three calculated bases: Positano for the iconic fantasy, Amalfi town for practical magic, or Ravello for elevated serenity. Each offers a completely different lens on this 50-kilometer stretch of coastline, and choosing the right one transforms a rushed weekend into a properly curated escape.

Most travelers attempt a checklist approach, cramming Positano, Amalfi, Ravello, and Capri into a long weekend, spending more time in shuttle buses than soaking up the Mediterranean light that makes this coastline legendary.

## Choose your base strategically

**Positano: For the Instagram-worthy fantasy**

Positano delivers exactly what you've seen in those impossibly perfect photos—pastel houses tumbling down cliffs like a watercolor painting come to life. The town has 4,000 residents but feels intimate when you know how to navigate it.

Stay at Le Sirenuse if budget allows (rooms from €800/night in shoulder season), or opt for Villa Franca (€300-450/night) for similar views without the celebrity premium. Both perch high enough that you'll wake up to that money-shot vista every morning.

The key to Positano is embracing the vertical geography. Take the internal shuttle bus (€1.30) from your hotel to the main square, then walk down to Spiaggia Grande. The 15-minute climb back up reveals why most visitors look perpetually winded.

> "Positano is a dream place that isn't quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone." — John Steinbeck understood the spell.

**Amalfi town: For practical romantics**

Amalfi town offers the sweet spot between accessibility and authenticity. The ferry connections here are superior—direct boats to Capri run every 90 minutes (€20 each way), and the bus terminal provides efficient links to Ravello (20 minutes, €1.30).

Book Marina Riviera (€180-280/night) right on the harbor square. You can literally roll out of bed and onto the Capri ferry. The hotel's sea-view rooms face the dramatic backdrop of Monte Cerreto, not just endless blue water.

The town's cathedral, with its Byzantine bronze doors from Constantinople, provides cultural weight that purely scenic villages lack. Climb the 62 steps to enter, then spend 20 minutes absorbing the mix of Norman, Arab, and Byzantine influences that shaped southern Italy.

**Ravello: For elevated tranquility**

Ravello sits 365 meters above sea level, which means two things: spectacular panoramic views and blissful distance from cruise ship crowds. The town hosts only 2,500 residents and maintains an almost Tuscan hilltop village atmosphere.

Villa Cimbrone offers the famous Terrace of Infinity, but for overnight stays, book Palazzo Avino (€400-650/night). The Michelin-starred restaurant Rossellinis and rooftop bar justify the premium, especially during sunset hour between 7:30-8:15 PM in summer.

The 25-minute bus ride from Amalfi town winds through lemon terraces and provides preview glimpses of why Wagner composed Parsifal here. Rent a Vespa from Positano Rent for €35/day if you want independence, though the narrow mountain roads demand confident driving skills.

## Time your visit ruthlessly

**September 15-October 15: The golden window**

This six-week period offers 75°F days, 65°F evenings, and significantly reduced crowds. Hotel rates drop 30-40% from peak summer pricing, and restaurants return to normal service after the August chaos.

Ferry schedules still run frequently to Capri (last departure 6:30 PM), but you'll actually find seats without advance booking. The Mediterranean maintains swimming temperature through October, hitting around 68°F.

**May 1-June 15: Spring revelation**

Wildflowers carpet the mountainsides, creating a completely different visual experience than the sun-bleached summer landscape. Hiking the Path of the Gods becomes genuinely pleasant rather than an endurance test.

Hotels offer shoulder-season pricing while providing full services. The famous Da Adolfo beach club in Positano opens weekends only until mid-June, meaning fewer beach crowds but limited casual dining options.

> "The best time to visit the Amalfi Coast is when everyone else thinks it's too early or too late."

## Essential experiences (not attractions)

**The boat perspective is mandatory**

Book a private boat for 4 hours through Positano Boats (€400 for up to 8 people). The coastline reveals its true drama from water level—those famous vertical towns appear even more improbable when viewed from below.

Stop at the Furore fjord, a narrow inlet invisible from the road. The 30-meter bridge spanning the gorge provides Instagram drama, but the real magic happens when you anchor in the emerald water below.

Captain Antonio (book through your concierge or contact Otherwhere for direct booking) knows the optimal timing for light and crowds at each photo stop. His 4:30 PM departure catches golden hour at multiple locations.

**Dining with intention**

Skip the tourist traps lining Positano's main beach. Instead, book Zass at Il San Pietro (tasting menu €180) for one spectacular meal overlooking Li Galli islands. The restaurant's organic garden supplies 70% of ingredients.

For authentic local experience, drive to Tramonti village (20 minutes inland from Amalfi) and eat at Da Emilia. This family-run osteria serves traditional dishes like scialatielli ai frutti di mare using recipes unchanged for three generations. Total cost for two with wine: €60.

La Sponda at Le Sirenuse creates pure theater with 400 candles lit each evening at sunset. The €95 tasting menu delivers substance beyond the Instagram moments—chef Matteo Temperini sources 80% of ingredients from Campania farms within 50 kilometers.

**The Path of the Gods (abbreviated version)**

The full 7.5-kilometer hike from Bomerano to Nocelle takes 3-4 hours and provides spectacular views, but most time-poor travelers lack proper footwear or fitness levels. Instead, take the SITA bus to Bomerano (€2.40) and hike only the first 45 minutes to the best viewpoint at Colle Serra.

This truncated version delivers 80% of the visual payoff with 30% of the effort. Return the same way, then catch the 2:15 PM bus back to Amalfi town. Total time commitment: 3 hours including transport.

## Logistical realities

**Naples to Amalfi Coast: Choose wisely**

Private transfer via companies like Amalfi Coast Transfers takes 75 minutes and costs €120-150, but removes all stress and provides commentary. The alternative involves Circumvesuviana train to Sorrento (70 minutes), then SITA bus along the coastal road (90 minutes more), saving money while adding complexity.

If flying into Naples, book the private transfer. If arriving by train from Rome, the public transport combination works fine and saves €100 per person.

**Getting around: Embrace limitations**

Renting a car sounds appealing until you experience the SS163 coastal road reality: 18-foot-wide passages carved into cliffs, with tour buses approaching from both directions. Parking in Positano costs €5/hour at Parcheggio Multipiano when spaces exist, which is rarely.

The SITA bus system connects major towns every 30 minutes (€1.30-2.40 per ride) but requires patience during peak hours. Buy a 24-hour unlimited pass for €8 if you plan multiple stops.

Otherwhere can arrange private drivers like Giuseppe Russo, who knows alternate routes through Agerola and parking strategies, turning logistical nightmares into seamless transitions between experiences.

> "The Amalfi Coast rewards those who surrender to its rhythm rather than impose their own timeline."
