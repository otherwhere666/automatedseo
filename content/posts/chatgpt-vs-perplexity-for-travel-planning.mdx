faqs:
  - question: "Can ChatGPT book flights and hotels for me?"
    answer: "No, ChatGPT cannot make actual bookings. It can only suggest options and create itineraries—you'll need to book everything separately through airlines and hotels."
  - question: "Does Perplexity have access to real-time flight prices?"
    answer: "Perplexity pulls current pricing data from sources like Google Flights and Kayak, but prices change constantly. Always verify directly with airlines before booking."
  - question: "Which AI tool is better for planning a multi-city European trip?"
    answer: "ChatGPT excels at creative multi-destination itineraries with logical routing, while Perplexity is better for checking train schedules and current visa requirements between countries."
  - question: "How accurate are restaurant recommendations from these AI tools?"
    answer: "ChatGPT often suggests restaurants from its training data (pre-2023), while Perplexity checks current operating status. Always verify hours and reservations directly with restaurants."

Both ChatGPT and Perplexity can spark brilliant travel ideas, but they solve different problems entirely. ChatGPT excels at creative brainstorming and detailed itinerary building, while Perplexity shines with real-time information and current pricing. Neither can actually book your trip or remember your preferences between conversations—a crucial gap that leaves most travelers stuck between inspiration and execution.

After testing both platforms extensively across dozens of trip scenarios, the choice comes down to what stage of planning you're in and how much hand-holding you need.

## ChatGPT: The creative travel companion

ChatGPT feels like texting that well-traveled friend who studied abroad in Prague and somehow always knows the perfect wine bar. It generates genuinely creative itineraries, suggests off-beat neighborhoods like Rome's Pigneto district or Berlin's Wedding, and can craft detailed day-by-day plans that feel thoughtfully curated rather than algorithmically assembled.

The strength lies in its conversational flow. You can say "I want something like Lisbon but less touristy" and ChatGPT will suggest Porto's Cedofeita neighborhood, complete with specific restaurant recommendations like Taberna Real do Fado and walking routes between the Ribeira district and Vila Nova de Gaia's port cellars. It understands context and nuance in ways that traditional search engines struggle with.

> "ChatGPT transforms vague wanderlust into actionable travel plans—but those plans exist only on your screen, not in your inbox."

Where ChatGPT stumbles is with current information. It confidently recommended Lenoir, a James Beard Award-winning restaurant in Austin that closed in 2022. Flight prices are pure fiction—it once quoted me $340 for a Los Angeles to Tokyo round-trip that actually costs $1,200-1,400. Hotel recommendations lean heavily toward properties like The Standard Hotels that were trendy in its training data, missing newer openings like The Hoxton or citizenM locations entirely.

The bigger issue is memory. ChatGPT forgets you exist the moment you close the chat. Your carefully outlined preferences for aisle seats, your Marriott Bonvoy Platinum status, your hatred of connecting flights through Newark—all erased. Every conversation starts from scratch.

## Perplexity: The fact-checking travel researcher

Perplexity approaches travel planning like a diligent research assistant. It pulls real-time information from multiple sources, shows you exactly where each piece of data comes from, and tends to be more accurate about current prices and availability.

Ask Perplexity about flight costs from San Francisco to Barcelona in October, and you'll get price ranges of $650-950 that actually align with reality, complete with citations to Google Flights, Kayak, and airline websites. Restaurant recommendations include recent reviews and current operating hours for places like Barcelona's Disfrutar or Cal Pep. Hotel suggestions reflect 2024 pricing—like €180-220 per night for Hotel Casa Fuster, not pre-pandemic rates of €120.

The interface feels more like advanced search than conversation. Perplexity excels at answering specific questions: "What's the weather like in Reykjavik in March?" (average 2°C with frequent rain) or "How much does a taxi from CDG to central Paris cost?" (€50-70 plus tolls). It's particularly strong for destination research—pulling together visa requirements, vaccination recommendations, and cultural context from authoritative sources.

> "Perplexity delivers travel facts with footnotes, but lacks the storytelling that transforms information into inspiration."

But Perplexity struggles with the creative leaps that make trip planning exciting. It can tell you that Lyon has excellent food, but it won't spontaneously suggest a food-focused itinerary connecting Lyon to San Sebastián via Toulouse and Biarritz. The responses feel more encyclopedic than experiential.

## The real-world test: Planning a long weekend in Portugal

To see how each platform performs in practice, I asked both to plan a four-day Portugal trip for someone interested in architecture and good wine.

ChatGPT immediately suggested splitting time between Porto and the Douro Valley, recommending specific quintas like Quinta do Seixo and Quinta da Pacheca for wine tastings and noting that Porto's azulejo tiles at São Bento Station would appeal to architecture lovers. It created a day-by-day itinerary with restaurant suggestions like The Yeatman's restaurant and Antiqvvm, walking routes through Ribeira, and even suggested taking the historic tram line 1 for harbor views toward Foz do Douro.

Perplexity provided more practical details: current train schedules from Porto's São Bento station to Peso da Régua (5 departures daily, €12.40 each way), actual pricing for Douro Valley tours ($85-120 per person through companies like Douro Azul), and up-to-date information about quinta opening hours. It correctly noted that quintas like Taylor's and Sandeman require advance reservations during harvest season and provided links to booking pages.

> "The best travel planning combines ChatGPT's creativity with Perplexity's fact-checking—but neither can turn plans into confirmed bookings."

ChatGPT's itinerary felt more inspiring and complete, but included Taberna do Real do Fado that had permanently closed during COVID and underestimated travel times between Porto's city center and the Douro Valley by 45 minutes. Perplexity's information was more reliable but required more prompting to build a cohesive narrative.

## The booking gap both platforms can't bridge

Here's where both AI platforms hit the same wall: they can plan your trip, but they can't book it. You'll spend hours comparing their suggestions against actual availability, checking if recommended hotels like The Yeatman or Casa da Calçada have rooms on your dates, and discovering that those "current" flight prices are already outdated.

The research-to-booking handoff is where most trip planning dies. You've invested mental energy crafting the perfect itinerary, but now face the tedious reality of checking availability across multiple websites, comparing Marriott Bonvoy versus Hilton Honors benefits, and actually putting money down on bookings that may not even exist.

This is precisely why services like Otherwhere exist—to bridge that gap between AI-generated ideas and confirmed travel plans. Rather than leaving you to execute someone else's recommendations, a dedicated travel concierge can search real inventory, provide actual prices, and handle the entire booking process.

## When to use each platform

**Choose ChatGPT when you need:**
- Creative itinerary inspiration
- Detailed day-by-day planning  
- Help articulating vague travel desires
- Conversational back-and-forth refinement
- Multi-destination trip connecting

**Choose Perplexity when you need:**
- Current prices and availability
- Factual destination information
- Visa and entry requirements
- Transportation schedules and costs
- Quick answers to specific questions

For most travelers, the optimal approach combines both: use ChatGPT for initial brainstorming and itinerary structure, then fact-check key details with Perplexity before moving to actual booking.

## Beyond planning to actual travel

The fundamental limitation of both platforms isn't their individual strengths or weaknesses—it's that they exist purely in the realm of ideas. Great travel planning should seamlessly flow from inspiration to confirmed reservations, respecting your preferences and loyalty programs along the way.
