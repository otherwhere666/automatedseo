faqs:
  - question: "How much should I budget per day in Prague in 2024?"
    answer: "Plan for €70-100 daily for mid-range travel. Dinner in Vinohrady costs €25-35 per person, beer is €3-4 at central pubs, and decent hotels start at €80 in shoulder season."
  - question: "What's the best alternative to visiting Charles Bridge at sunrise?"
    answer: "Visit around 9 PM in summer when tour groups leave but lighting remains dramatic, or during light rain. Better yet, try Kampa Island's Lovers Bridge or the Dancing House bridge for castle views without crowds."
  - question: "Which Prague neighborhoods should I visit instead of the overcrowded ones?"
    answer: "Skip the AI-recommended Vinohrady and Karlín. Try Vršovice for working-class pubs and Vietnamese restaurants, Smíchov beyond the shopping centers, or Holešovice for industrial-chic galleries without tour groups."
  - question: "Does Prague's public transport work as ChatGPT describes?"
    answer: "Partly. You must validate paper tickets in yellow machines or face €50 fines. Tram line 22 serves tourists better than metro routes. Often walking is faster—Prague Castle to Wenceslas Square takes 25 minutes on foot."

ChatGPT thinks it knows Prague, but ask any local and they'll tell you otherwise. The AI churns out the same tired advice about Charles Bridge at sunrise and €50 daily budgets that haven't been realistic since 2019. After spending considerable time in the Czech capital and watching countless travelers follow ChatGPT's generic playbook, I've noticed seven consistent gaps where the AI falls short of actual, current Prague reality.

Here's what ChatGPT consistently gets wrong, and what you should know instead.

---

## It recommends visiting Charles Bridge at sunrise (like everyone else)

ChatGPT's most predictable Prague advice? "Visit Charles Bridge at sunrise for fewer crowds." This suggestion has become so common that 6 AM now brings its own mini-rush of photographers and early risers, all following the same AI-generated itinerary.

The better move: Visit during light rain or around 9 PM in summer when the tour groups have departed but the lighting is still dramatic. The bridge takes on an entirely different character when locals use it as an actual commute route rather than a photo opportunity.

> "The most magical Prague moments happen when you stop chasing the Instagram shot everyone else is getting."

Even better, skip Charles Bridge entirely on your first day. Head to Kampa Island's quieter Lovers Bridge or walk across the modern Dancing House bridge for views back toward Prague Castle without the selfie stick dodging.

## It quotes outdated prices that make no sense

ChatGPT consistently suggests Prague daily budgets of €30-50, apparently frozen in time around 2018. Current reality check: A dinner at Lokál Dlouhááá runs €25-35 per person, and even basic rooms at Hotel Golden Key in Lesser Town start around €80 in shoulder season.

The AI also quotes beer prices at €1-2, when Pilsner Urquell costs €3.50 at U Fleků and €4.20 at pubs near Old Town Square. These aren't tourist traps—it's inflation hitting a city that's rapidly catching up with Western European pricing.

For accurate budgeting, figure €70-100 daily for mid-range travel, including accommodation. Yes, you can still find €2.50 beers at neighborhood pubs like Hospoda Na Špici in Smíchov, but they're in residential areas where ChatGPT wouldn't think to send you anyway.

---

## It sends everyone to the same "authentic" neighborhoods

Ask ChatGPT for authentic Prague experiences, and it robotically suggests Vinohrady and Karlín. These neighborhoods are lovely, but they've become victim to their own AI-generated fame. Every food tour now stops at Eska restaurant and Krystal Mozaika Bistro in Karlín, creating artificial crowding in areas that were genuinely local just five years ago.

The actually authentic Prague neighborhoods? Try Vršovice for working-class pubs like Hospůdka Na Celnici and Vietnamese restaurants along Moskevská street, or Smíchov beyond Nový Smíchov shopping center. These areas rarely appear in ChatGPT responses because they lack the neat, tourable narrative that AI prefers.

Holešovice offers another alternative—Kasárna Karlín cultural center and Pivovar Matuška brewery without the guided tour crowds that now descend on Karlín's recommended spots like Cross Club.

---

## It ignores seasonal realities completely

ChatGPT treats Prague like it exists in perpetual mild weather, rarely accounting for how dramatically the city changes between seasons. It suggests the same outdoor activities whether you're visiting in February (average high: 4°C) or August.

Winter Prague requires indoor backup plans that AI rarely provides. The city's Christmas markets at Wenceslas Square and Old Town Square run through January 6, not just December as ChatGPT often states. Prague Castle reduces winter hours to 9 AM-4 PM from November through March, and many Petřin Hill attractions close entirely.

> "Prague's personality shifts completely with the seasons, but AI gives you the same advice year-round."

Summer brings different challenges: Tourist crowds peak in July-August, making reservations at restaurants like Sansho or Field essential 3-4 days ahead. The AI rarely mentions this booking reality for Prague's top dining spots.

---

## It doesn't understand Prague's transport quirks

ChatGPT confidently explains Prague's public transport but misses crucial details that trip up actual visitors. It mentions the integrated DPP ticket system but fails to explain that you must validate paper tickets in those easy-to-miss yellow machines—skip this step and face €50 fines from inspectors who target tourist areas.

The AI also oversells metro convenience. Yes, Prague has three metro lines (A, B, C), but they primarily serve commuter routes to Anděl and Náměstí Míru. For most tourist destinations, trams prove more useful and scenic. Tram 22 specifically hits Prague Castle, Lesser Town, National Theatre, and Vinohrady—more visitor-relevant stops than any metro combination.

ChatGPT rarely mentions that Prague's historic center spans just 2.5 kilometers. The walk from Wenceslas Square to Prague Castle takes 25 minutes through Národní street and Kampa Island, while following ChatGPT's metro-plus-tram routing takes nearly as long with less to see.

---

## It can't book anything (obviously)

This limitation seems obvious but creates real friction when you're ready to act on Prague travel plans. ChatGPT can suggest Hotel Augustine in Lesser Town or Hotel Josef in Josefov, but you'll need to open multiple browser tabs, compare rates across Booking.com and Hotels.com, and handle the reservation process yourself.

Flight suggestions prove even more problematic. ChatGPT might recommend Lufthansa routing through Munich or Austrian Airlines via Vienna, but it can't check actual availability, current prices starting at €320 from London, or seat options for your March travel dates.

This is where purpose-built travel AI like Otherwhere makes sense. Instead of generic suggestions, you get actual flight options on Czech Airlines and hotel availability at places like the Aria Hotel Prague with real March rates of €140/night—then we handle the entire booking process while you decide.

---

## It gives generic food advice that misses current trends

ChatGPT's Prague restaurant recommendations read like a 2020 guidebook. It suggests goulash at U Modré Kachničky and svíčková na smetaně at Café Savoy while missing the city's evolving food scene entirely.

Prague's current dining story involves Vietnamese-Czech fusion at Pho Vietnam Tuan & Lan, innovative takes on traditional ingredients at Divinis, and craft beer at Bernard Pub that extends far beyond Pilsner Urquell. The AI consistently misses these developments.

> "Prague's food scene moves faster than AI training data can keep up with."

Specific examples: ChatGPT rarely mentions Sapa district's authentic Vietnamese restaurants or natural wine bars like Wine Food Market that have transformed Vinohrady. It suggests tourist-heavy beer halls like U Fleků while ignoring microbreweries like Únětický pivovar that locals actually frequent.

For current recommendations, follow Czech food bloggers like @praguefoodie on Instagram or check what's trending on local accounts—sources that update faster than AI models.

## The bottom line on AI travel planning

ChatGPT excels at brainstorming and initial research, but it can't replace current local knowledge or handle actual booking logistics. Its Prague advice reflects training data from 2021-2023, not real-time reality—fine for general orientation, problematic for specific planning.

The most effective approach combines AI brainstorming with human expertise for execution. Use ChatGPT to explore initial ideas, then work with services that can verify current information and handle bookings.
