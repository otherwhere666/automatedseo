    answer: "August during the Edinburgh Festival when rates at The Balmoral jump to £600+ per night and The Witchery books out 6 months ahead."

    answer: "The Balmoral on Princes Street—you're above Waverley Station, 5 minutes from the Royal Mile, and the concierge team knows every Edinburgh secret."
  - question: "Do any of these hotels offer airport transfers?"
    answer: "The Balmoral provides Bentley transfers for £85, The Scotsman arranges taxis for £35, and The Witchery expects you to find your own way (typical for a 9-suite property)."
  - question: "Which property has the best restaurant?"
    answer: "Number One at The Balmoral holds a Michelin star, but The Witchery's Gothic dining rooms create a more memorable experience even if the food is merely excellent."

Edinburgh isn't about choosing from 200 hotels—it's about picking the right neighborhood and the right property within it. After testing dozens of properties over five years (and enduring plenty of mediocre hotel breakfasts), I've narrowed it down to three exceptional choices that cover every type of traveler. Whether you're after castle views from Castlehill or Georgian elegance on Princes Street, these are the only Edinburgh hotels worth your time and money.

## The Witchery by the Castle: For maximum atmosphere

Located 50 meters from Edinburgh Castle's entrance on Castlehill, The Witchery delivers Gothic drama like nowhere else in Scotland. This isn't a hotel in the traditional sense—it's nine theatrical suites tucked into a 16th-century merchant's house that feels more like a film set than accommodation.

The suites are outrageously over-the-top. The Vestry features a genuine priest hole and 17th-century ecclesiastical antiques sourced from Scottish abbeys. The Armoury comes with medieval weapons on oak-paneled walls and a Victorian roll-top bath that weighs 800 pounds. Every suite includes hand-carved four-poster beds, Flemish tapestries, and enough candlelight to make you feel like you're plotting something medieval.

> "The Witchery doesn't just offer a room—it offers total immersion in Edinburgh's dark, romantic past where every surface tells a 400-year-old story."

Yes, it's expensive (suites start at £495 per night, rising to £795 for the Armoury). Yes, the rooms feel cramped by modern standards—some bathrooms are barely six feet wide. But if you want to wake up to Edinburgh Castle filling your leaded windows and fall asleep surrounded by centuries of accumulated atmosphere, nothing else comes close.

The restaurant downstairs serves exceptional Scottish cuisine in two dining rooms that look like they hosted royal conspiracies. The Secret Garden occupies a 16th-century courtyard with a retractable roof. Book the Armoury suite if possible—the direct castle view from the bedroom is worth the £300 premium.

## The Balmoral: For timeless luxury

Standing guard over the east end of Princes Street like a grand Edwardian sentinel, The Balmoral has been Edinburgh's premier luxury address since 1902. The clock tower (kept three minutes fast so guests never miss their train to London) has become as integral to the Edinburgh skyline as the Scott Monument 200 meters away.

This is old-school luxury executed flawlessly. The 188 rooms blend Edwardian grandeur with contemporary comfort—think Turnbull & Asser tartans, hand-polished mahogany furnishings, and Carrara marble bathrooms with Penhaligon's amenities. Corner suites on floors six and seven offer some of Edinburgh's finest panoramas, taking in both Edinburgh Castle and the Princes Street Gardens.

The location remains unbeatable after 120 years. You're literally above Waverley Station platforms 1-6, making arrivals from London King's Cross effortless. The Royal Mile is a 350-meter walk uphill via the Mound. Harvey Nichols and the Princes Street shopping district start at your front door.

> "The Balmoral understands that true luxury isn't about showing off with gold fixtures—it's about anticipating every need before you realize you have it."

Number One restaurant holds a Michelin star under chef Mark Donald, serving modern Scottish cuisine that actually justifies the accolades. The North British Bar stocks over 500 single malts, including 30-year Macallans and limited Ardbeg releases you won't find elsewhere. Service runs formal but warm—the kind of establishment where staff remember your coffee preferences after one stay.

Rooms start at £385 per night for city-view standards, rising to £695 for castle-view suites. The hotel's "Taste of Scotland" packages include breakfast at Brasserie Prince and seven-course tasting dinners, often providing better value than booking separately. Request rooms 601-615 for optimal castle perspectives.

## The Scotsman: For design-conscious travelers

Housed in the former headquarters of The Scotsman newspaper at the top of the North Bridge, this boutique property brings Art Deco sophistication to Edinburgh's Old Town. The limestone building's 1905 façade conceals 69 rooms that feel more like a private members' club than typical tourist accommodation.

The design strikes an ideal balance between heritage preservation and contemporary comfort. Original Sicilian marble staircases and bronze handrails remain untouched, but rooms feature curated Scottish artwork from the Edinburgh College of Art and furniture actually chosen by someone with developed taste. The newspaper theme runs throughout intelligently—vintage Scotsman front pages from 1872 line the corridors, and the Printing Press Bar occupies what was once the newsroom floor.

Location-wise, you're on the Royal Mile but positioned 400 meters east of Edinburgh Castle to avoid the worst tourist crowds. The building's central courtyard provides surprising quiet despite the city center setting, and many rooms overlook the Firth of Forth rather than busy Cockburn Street below.

> "The Scotsman proves that boutique hotels can develop genuine personality without sacrificing the comfort details or professional service that matter most."

The spa, built into the building's former basement printing presses, includes Scotland's only stainless steel swimming pool—an unusual 20-meter installation that somehow works perfectly within the industrial heritage space. The North Bridge Brasserie serves excellent modern Scottish food without the stuffiness that plagues most hotel restaurants.

Rates typically run £245-320 per night, making it exceptional value for this level of design consideration and service standards. Request rooms 301-315 on the Firth of Forth side—the water views toward Leith are unexpectedly beautiful, particularly during Edinburgh's long summer sunsets around 9:30 PM.

## Why these three matter

Each hotel occupies a distinct niche that covers how people actually want to experience Edinburgh. The Witchery for pure atmosphere and romance. The Balmoral for traditional luxury and perfect positioning. The Scotsman for contemporary design and intelligent value.

I've deliberately skipped the obvious chains and budget options. Not because they're terrible, but because Edinburgh deserves better than generic accommodation. This city has accumulated 900 years of character—your hotel should reflect that depth.

All three properties understand something crucial about Edinburgh hospitality: service should be warm without being intrusive, and luxury means getting the operational details right, not showing off with flashy amenities that photograph well but don't enhance your actual stay.

The booking process for any of these can be surprisingly complex, especially during Festival season (August) when availability becomes scarce and rates spike dramatically. The Witchery's nine suites book out six months ahead, while The Balmoral's best castle-view rooms disappear by March for summer stays. That's where Otherwhere comes in—we handle the entire booking process, monitor for better rates, and ensure you get confirmed reservations with all the details sorted properly.
