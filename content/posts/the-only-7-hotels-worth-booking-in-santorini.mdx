Santorini has roughly 400 hotels scattered across its volcanic cliffs, but only seven deserve your attention. After years of visiting clients and personally staying at dozens of properties, I can tell you that most are either overpriced tourist traps or charming but fatally flawed. These seven hotels represent the sweet spot of location, service, and that ineffable Santorini magic—without the usual compromises.

Here's the truth about Santorini hotels: the Instagram-famous infinity pools come with paper-thin walls, and the "authentic cave houses" often lack basic soundproofing. The properties below have cracked the code on delivering both atmosphere and actual comfort.

## The crown jewel: Katikies Oia

Katikies sits on the quieter northern end of Oia's famous marble walkway, 200 meters from the windmill tourist cluster where you can actually hear yourself think. Built into the cliff face at 300 meters above sea level, its 34 suites cascade down toward the Aegean in a series of pristine white terraces.

The infinity pool here isn't just a photo op—it's positioned to catch the morning light while staying shaded during the scorching 2-4 PM hours. Smart design that most properties miss entirely.

> "The only Santorini hotel where the sunset views don't come with shoulder-to-shoulder tourists peering over your balcony."

What sets Katikies apart is the service density: 28 staff members for 34 suites, which means your champagne appears before you realize you wanted it. Suites start at €820 in peak season, but the Honeymoon Suite (€1,240) includes a 45-square-meter private terrace that feels like your own slice of the caldera.

The catch? Book at least six months ahead for July-August dates. This isn't the place for spontaneous getaways.

## The accessible luxury: Grace Santorini

Grace proves you don't need to mortgage your house for a proper Santorini experience. Perched in Imerovigli at 350 meters elevation—the highest point on the caldera rim—it offers the same jaw-dropping views as Oia without the cruise ship crowds that dock 2 kilometers below in Athinios Port.

The property's 20 suites are studies in Cycladic minimalism: white walls, polished concrete floors, and 4-meter floor-to-ceiling windows that frame Nea Kameni volcano like living artwork. The Infinity Suite lives up to its name with a 32-square-meter private pool that appears to merge with the sea 300 meters below.

Grace's restaurant, Varoulko, earned its Michelin star in 2023 for chef Lefteris Lazarou's refined take on Greek seafood. The langoustine with Santorini capers and kritharaki pasta alone justifies the €85 tasting menu. Rooms start at €470 in high season—reasonable by Santorini standards.

The location advantage is real: Imerovigli sits equidistant between Oia (3.2 km) and Fira (1.8 km), so you can walk to both without dealing with the island's notoriously unreliable KTEL bus system that runs every 90 minutes.

## The wine lover's retreat: Canaves Oia Epitome

Canaves Epitome occupies 4.2 hectares of prime real estate on Oia's northwestern edge, where the caldera views stretch uninterrupted 12 kilometers to Thirasia island. But what makes this property special is its wine program—Greece's most serious hotel cellar outside of Athens.

The hotel's sommelier, Maria Tzitzifi, has assembled 240 Greek wines, including vintages of Santorini's legendary Assyrtiko from Argyros Estate dating back to 1989. The private wine cave dinners (€165 per person) pair these bottles with ingredients sourced from the hotel's 2-hectare organic farm in Pyrgos village.

Each of the 24 villas comes with a private heated pool maintained at 26°C—crucial for April-May and October visits when the Aegean drops to 18°C. The Presidential Villa's 60-square-meter pool measures larger than most Manhattan studios.

> "The only place in Santorini where you can taste wines that predate the island's tourism boom—and understand what you've been missing."

Rates hover around €720-920 for standard villas, with the Presidential reaching €2,480. Worth it for serious oenophiles who want to explore Greece's wine revolution beyond the typical Boutari and Hatzidakis pours.

## The authentic experience: Perivolas Oia

Perivolas feels like staying in a traditional Cycladic village—if villages came with infinity pools and Michelin-recommended restaurants. The property's 21 cave houses and traditional dwellings spread across a 3-hectare cliff-side compound that's remained largely unchanged since its 1983 opening.

This is Santorini's original luxury hotel, and it shows in the details other properties miss. The stone walls are actually carved 2.5 meters into the volcanic pumice, providing natural cooling that maintains 22°C interiors when outside temperatures reach 35°C. Each room features handmade furniture crafted by Naxos artisan Yiannis Kaklamanis using traditional Cycladic woodworking techniques.

The hotel's beach club at Columbo Beach gives you access to Santorini's black sand beaches without the usual crowds from Kamari and Perissa. A private speedboat shuttles guests there each morning at 9:30 AM—a nice touch when you realize most hotels just hand you bus directions to Monolithos.

Rooms start at €520 in peak season, making Perivolas surprisingly accessible for its level of authenticity and service. Book the Traditional House (€580) for the full cave dwelling experience with 3.5-meter ceilings that prevent claustrophobia.

## The modern marvel: Andronis Concept Wellness Resort

Andronis Concept opened in May 2019 as Santorini's first serious wellness-focused luxury property. Located in Imerovigli's quieter southern section, it combines caldera views with a spa program that goes beyond the usual Greek island massage offerings.

The standout treatment is the 90-minute "Volcanic Detox" (€180) using black lava stones sourced from Santorini's beaches, heated to precisely 54°C. Sounds gimmicky, but the mineral content—including sulfur and pumice—actually works wonders on sun-damaged skin according to dermatological studies from the University of Athens.

All 23 suites feature private pools with built-in hydromassage systems from Italian manufacturer Teuco. The technology is subtle enough to maintain the Cycladic aesthetic while adding genuine functionality. The Master Suite's 12-meter pool has one end cantilevered 1.2 meters over the cliff face.

> "Finally, a Santorini hotel that recognizes you might want to do more than just Instagram and drink wine—though it excels at both."

The restaurant focuses on plant-forward Mediterranean cuisine under chef Dimitris Katrivesis, unusual for an island obsessed with grilled octopus. The breakfast alone—featuring house-made almond and oat milks, thyme honey from Thirasia, and vegetables from their hydroponic greenhouse—sets this place apart.

Expect to pay €680-870 for standard suites, with the Master Suite reaching €1,850. The wellness programming justifies the premium if you're seeking more than just another pretty hotel.

## The boutique gem: Mystique Resort

Mystique occupies 2.8 hectares of dramatic coastline in Oia's southeastern section, with suites built into natural caves that date back three centuries. But don't mistake this for a rustic experience—the property seamlessly blends historical architecture with contemporary luxury.

The resort's 18 suites each feature private terraces with unobstructed caldera views. More importantly, they're positioned 150 meters below Oia's main tourist pathways along Nikolaou Nomikou street. You get the iconic location without the constant foot traffic of 15,000 daily visitors in summer.

The infinity pool here deserves special mention—it's heated to 25°C year-round and positioned to catch both sunrise at 6:47 AM and sunset at 7:23 PM during peak season. Most Santorini pools only optimize for one or the other.

Mystique's restaurant, Charisma, serves modern Greek cuisine under chef Yiannis Baxevanis that actually tastes like food rather than Instagram content. The grilled catch-of-the-day with Santorini fava beans and sea fennel showcases local ingredients without the usual tourist markup on quality—market price typically runs €38-45.

Rates range from €465-720 for cave suites, making this one of the more accessible options on this list. The Panorama Suite (€940) includes a private hot tub carved directly into the volcanic rock—a unique feature you won't find elsewhere.

## The family-friendly option: Vedema Resort

Most luxury Santorini hotels treat children like unwelcome accessories. Vedema, located in the quieter village of Megalochori (population 400), actually welcomes families while maintaining sophisticated style.

The property occupies a restored 400-year-old Canava Roussos winery, with 45 suites and villas spread across 7 hectares of manicured gardens and courtyards. The architecture follows traditional Cycladic principles, but the scale feels more like a village than a typical resort.

Children's amenities go beyond the usual pool games. The resort offers twice-weekly cooking classes where kids aged 6-14 learn to make spanakopita and baklava with pastry chef Elena Matsoukas, plus guided tours of the surrounding Santo Wines vineyards. The kids' club operates in a restored wine cellar—atmospheric without being scary.

For parents, Vedema provides the space to actually relax. Suites are soundproofed to 45-decibel standards and spacious (minimum 55 square meters), with separate living areas where children can play while adults enjoy caldera sunset views from private terraces.

The pool complex includes both adult-only sections (operational 4-7 PM daily) and family areas, preventing the usual territorial battles. Rates start at €420 for family suites—remarkable value considering most Santorini properties charge €180+ just for extra bed setup.

## Getting it booked right

These seven properties represent the best of what Santorini offers, but booking them requires strategy. Summer availability disappears by mid-February, and the best suites often sell out for the entire season within weeks of opening bookings in November.

Rather than spending hours comparing rates across multiple booking sites—many of which don't even have access to these properties' best rooms—consider letting Otherwhere handle the logistics. We maintain direct relationships with these hotels and can often secure suites that don't appear on public booking platforms, plus negotiate upgrades and perks like private airport transfers.

> "Book through someone who knows which Grace Santorini suites actually have unobstructed caldera views, and which ones face the neighboring construction site."

Text us at (323) 922-4067 with your travel dates and preferences. We'll present you with 3-5 options from this curated list, complete with real-time availability and current rates, then handle the entire booking process once you decide.

Because the last thing you want is to arrive in Santorini only to discover your "luxury suite" overlooks the Kamari water treatment plant instead of the caldera.
