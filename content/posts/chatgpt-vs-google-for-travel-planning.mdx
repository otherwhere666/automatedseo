faqs:
  - question: "Can ChatGPT book actual flights and hotels?"
    answer: "No, ChatGPT cannot access real-time inventory or make bookings. It can only provide suggestions based on training data, which may not reflect current prices or availability."
  - question: "Why does Google Flights show different prices than booking sites?"
    answer: "Google displays cached prices that may be 15-30 minutes old. Final prices can change due to dynamic pricing, seat availability, or booking site fees not shown in Google's initial results."
  - question: "How accurate are ChatGPT's hotel price estimates?"
    answer: "ChatGPT's price estimates can be off by 50-200%, especially during peak seasons or major events. Always verify pricing through Google Hotels or direct booking sites."
  - question: "What's the biggest mistake people make with AI travel planning?"
    answer: "Trusting ChatGPT's price estimates without verification. Many travelers plan entire itineraries around budget assumptions that turn out to be completely wrong."

ChatGPT excels at sparking travel inspiration and crafting detailed itineraries, but it can't verify flight prices or make actual bookings. Google dominates for research and price comparison but drowns you in endless tabs and decision fatigue. The reality? Both have significant blind spots that can derail your travel planning before you've even packed a bag.

After planning dozens of trips using both platforms, I've learned exactly where each shines—and where they spectacularly fail. Here's the unvarnished truth about using AI versus traditional search for your next adventure.

## Where ChatGPT actually helps

ChatGPT transforms travel brainstorming from overwhelming to exciting. Ask it for "wine regions in Portugal under 2 hours from Porto," and you'll get specific suggestions like Quinta da Pacheca in the Douro Valley and Adega Mayor in Alentejo instead of the usual Lisbon-Porto circuit.

The AI's strength lies in synthesizing information you didn't know to ask for. It connects dots between your interests, budget preferences, and travel dates in ways that feel genuinely helpful rather than algorithmic.

> "ChatGPT's real superpower isn't finding flights—it's helping you figure out what kind of trip you actually want to take."

I've used it to plan everything from a wine-focused week in Slovenia's Vipava Valley to a digital nomad route through Canggu, Da Nang, and Penang. The itineraries feel thoughtful, not templated. ChatGPT remembers that you mentioned loving small museums and weaves that into recommendations like the Mimara Museum in Zagreb or the Pinang Peranakan Mansion in George Town.

But here's where the magic stops: the moment you need real prices, availability, or actual bookings.

## The ChatGPT travel trap

ChatGPT's travel advice comes with a massive caveat: it's making educated guesses based on training data, not real-time information. Those "budget-friendly" hotels it recommends? They might be booked solid or cost triple what the AI suggests.

I learned this the hard way planning a trip to Japan. ChatGPT confidently recommended Hakone Ginyu ryokan for "around $180 per night." The actual price during cherry blossom season? $420, and fully booked three months out anyway.

Flight prices are even more unreliable. The AI might suggest a $650 roundtrip fare from JFK to Rome that doesn't exist, sending you down rabbit holes of phantom deals and frustration. Delta's actual pricing for the same route during summer season runs $950-$1,200.

> "ChatGPT is brilliant at the 'what' and 'where' of travel planning, but completely blind to the 'how much' and 'when available.'"

Most travelers end up using ChatGPT for inspiration, then switching to Google to verify everything. It's a clunky workflow that wastes the momentum AI can create.

## Google's research dominance

Google remains unmatched for travel research depth. Google Flights shows price trends across six months, alerts you to cheaper airports like Newark versus JFK (often $100-200 difference), and tracks fare changes with email notifications.

Google Hotels displays real inventory from 47,000+ properties with verified reviews and exact pricing including taxes and fees. You can filter by specific amenities like rooftop pools, see which Marriott properties in Bangkok have club lounges, or find boutique hotels in Rome's Trastevere neighborhood under €200.

Google Maps integration adds another layer of utility. You can visualize that the Hotel de Russie in Rome is actually a 12-minute walk to the Spanish Steps, check exact distances between your hotel and metro stations, and preview street views of neighborhoods like Brera in Milan before committing.

But Google's comprehensiveness becomes its weakness when you're trying to make actual decisions.

## The Google overwhelm problem

Google presents information without curation. Search for flights from LAX to Barcelona and you'll get 73 options across American, Delta, United, Lufthansa, Air France, and 12 other carriers, with departure times from 6:15am to 11:45pm. Each choice spawns more questions: Is TAP Air Portugal reliable? Will Kayak honor this fare or add fees at checkout? Do I really need that 6am departure to save $60?

The platform assumes you want maximum choice, but most travelers want thoughtful selection. After 30 minutes comparing American's nonstop ($1,180) versus Lufthansa's one-stop via Munich ($890), you're no closer to booking—just more confused about whether that Frankfurt layover is worth the savings.

> "Google gives you every option; what you actually need is the right option."

Hotel searches create even more decision paralysis. In central Paris, you'll see 340+ properties from Hotel des Grands Boulevards (€280/night) to the Four Seasons George V (€1,200/night), spread across Saint-Germain, Le Marais, Opera, and eight other districts. The cognitive load becomes exhausting.

## The missing piece: Execution

Both ChatGPT and Google leave you hanging at the most crucial moment—actually booking your trip. ChatGPT can't access real inventory systems. Google pushes you to third-party sites like Expedia, Booking.com, or Priceline that may show different final prices due to taxes, fees, or dynamic pricing changes.

You end up juggling 15+ browser tabs, creating accounts on Kayak, Momondo, and directly with airlines, then hoping your $890 Lufthansa fare doesn't jump to $1,040 while you're entering passport details for the fourth time because Expedia's payment system crashed.

This gap between research and execution is where most travel planning falls apart. You've invested three hours researching Barcelona hotels but still face the friction of actually securing that room at Hotel Casa Fuster for €340/night.

## A better approach

The future of travel planning isn't choosing between AI and traditional search—it's combining the strengths of both while solving the execution problem.

Start with ChatGPT for inspiration and high-level planning. Let it help you discover destinations, understand seasonal considerations, and craft rough itineraries. Use its conversational interface to refine ideas: "Actually, make that Barcelona trip more focused on Gaudí architecture and Catalan cuisine, less on beach time."

Move to Google for verification and research. Check that Hotel Casa Fuster is actually €340 in October, read September 2023 reviews mentioning the rooftop terrace renovation, and confirm availability. Use Google Flights to see that October flights from JFK run $200 cheaper than September.

But for the booking itself? That's where Otherwhere bridges the gap. Instead of wrestling with Expedia's booking flow or wondering if that Lufthansa fare is legitimate, you describe your Barcelona preferences and receive curated options with real prices from actual inventory. When you decide on the Hotel Casa Fuster and that Lufthansa flight, the booking happens for you—confirmation numbers, e-tickets, and all.

## The reality check

Neither ChatGPT nor Google is perfect for travel planning, but both serve important roles. ChatGPT sparks creativity and helps clarify preferences. Google provides the factual foundation for smart decisions.

The key is understanding their limitations and having a plan for execution. The most detailed Barcelona itinerary means nothing if you can't actually book that €340 hotel room at the prices you researched.

Smart travelers use each tool for what it does best, then find efficient ways to bridge the gap between planning and booking. Because at the end of the day, the best travel tool is the one that actually gets you on the plane to Barcelona.
