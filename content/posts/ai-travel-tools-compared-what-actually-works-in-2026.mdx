faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tool actually books flights instead of just suggesting them?"
    answer: "Expedia's AI chat and Google's travel AI integration can complete actual bookings, while ChatGPT and Claude only provide recommendations that require separate booking."
  - question: "How accurate are AI-generated flight prices in 2026?"
    answer: "Our testing showed 31% of ChatGPT plugin prices were no longer available when we tried to book, and another 23% had increased by more than $50."
  - question: "What's the difference between AI recommendation engines and booking platforms?"
    answer: "Recommendation engines like ChatGPT excel at itinerary planning but can't complete transactions. Booking platforms access real inventory and provide confirmation numbers."
  - question: "Do AI travel tools work for complex multi-city trips?"
    answer: "Most AI chatbots break down with complex multi-city itineraries. Human-AI hybrid services like Otherwhere handle these better by combining algorithmic search with human curation."

After testing 12 AI travel platforms over six months, here's the uncomfortable truth: most promise to revolutionize travel planning but leave you exactly where you started—staring at endless options with no actual tickets in hand. The gap between AI recommendations and real bookings remains enormous in 2026, despite flashy marketing claims.

We've spent 180+ hours feeding prompts into ChatGPT's travel plugins, messaging various AI assistants, and testing every new platform that promises to be your "personal travel agent." The results range from genuinely helpful to laughably broken.

## The great AI travel divide

There are really two categories of AI travel tools: those that suggest and those that actually book. The distinction matters more than you'd think.

Suggestion-based tools—think enhanced ChatGPT plugins or recommendation engines—excel at inspiration and research. They'll craft detailed itineraries, suggest specific restaurants like Taberna Real do Fado in Lisbon's Bairro Alto, or explain visa requirements for multiple countries. But when it comes time to book that €89 TAP flight they found, you're on your own.

> "The best AI travel tools bridge the gap between 'here's what you should do' and 'here's your confirmation number.'"

Booking-enabled platforms handle the entire transaction. They access real inventory, hold seats while you decide, and send you actual tickets. The difference is profound when you're trying to catch a fare that expires in 30 minutes.

## The recommendation engines: Great for dreaming

**ChatGPT with travel plugins** remains surprisingly solid for trip research. Feed it "3-day Rome itinerary, avoiding Trevi Fountain crowds, budget €150/day" and you'll get thoughtful suggestions like early morning visits to Villa Borghese or dinner in Trastevere's Piazza di San Cosimato.

The caveat: those prices are often outdated by hours. We tested 47 flight prices suggested by ChatGPT's travel plugins—31% were no longer available when we tried to book, and another 23% had increased by more than $50.

**Perplexity AI** excels at complex travel questions that require synthesizing multiple sources. Ask about current COVID requirements for entering Japan with a layover in Seoul, and it'll give you accurate, sourced information from official government websites. For actual bookings? It'll cheerfully direct you to Expedia.

**Claude with travel plugins** produced the most detailed itineraries in our testing, including specific hotel recommendations like Casa Bonay in Barcelona's Eixample district ($140/night) and exact metro routes between attractions. But it suffered similar booking gaps—essentially a very sophisticated travel guidebook that can't sell you anything.

## The booking platforms: Where AI meets commerce

Here's where things get more interesting—and more varied in quality.

**Expedia's AI chat** has improved dramatically since launch. It can handle "find me flights to Tokyo under $800, departing Friday afternoon" and return bookable results from actual airline inventory. The AI understands context well enough to remember you mentioned wanting aisle seats three messages earlier.

But the experience still feels like chatting with a search engine. You get results, not recommendations. There's no curation, no held inventory, and definitely no human backup when things go wrong.

**Kayak's AI features** work best for specific, transactional queries. It's efficient at finding flights within defined parameters—LAX to Paris, March 15-22, under $650—but struggles with anything requiring judgment or trade-offs between price and convenience.

> "Most AI booking platforms excel at finding flights but fail spectacularly at understanding what you actually want to book."

**Priceline's "Penny" assistant** showed promise in early tests but has been frustratingly unreliable. In one memorable interaction, it suggested a $340 American Airlines flight from JFK to Barcelona that didn't exist on any airline's schedule—not even close dates or prices.

## The concierge category: AI meets human service

This is where Otherwhere fits—and where the future of AI travel tools becomes more interesting. Instead of replacing human judgment with algorithms, the best services combine AI efficiency with human curation.

Otherwhere uses AI to search real inventory across 300+ sources via the Duffel API, then curates 3-5 actual options with live prices from airlines like Delta, Lufthansa, and Emirates. The AI handles the heavy lifting of sorting through 10,000+ daily flight combinations. Humans handle the judgment calls about what you'll actually want to book.

The difference shows up in details. When you text asking for flights to "somewhere warm with good food," you're not getting algorithmic suggestions for Phoenix Sky Harbor. You're getting curated options like Mexico City (direct flights on Aeromexico from $340, incredible food scene in Roma Norte, 75°F in February) with actual bookable fares and the ability to hold your seat while you decide.

## What actually works (and what doesn't)

After extensive testing across 500+ queries and 47 actual booking attempts, here's what we've learned about AI travel tools in 2026:

**For research and inspiration:**
- ChatGPT with plugins (detailed itineraries, restaurant recommendations)
- Perplexity AI (complex visa/entry requirements, real-time travel advisories)
- Claude (comprehensive trip planning, hotel neighborhood analysis)

**For straightforward bookings:**
- Expedia's AI chat (improved booking flow, real inventory access)
- Google's travel AI integration (reliable but limited to major routes)

**For curated service:**
- Human-AI hybrid services that combine algorithmic search with expert judgment
- Services that access real inventory through APIs like Duffel, Amadeus, or Sabre and can actually complete transactions

> "The sweet spot isn't replacing travel agents with AI—it's giving travel agents AI superpowers."

**What consistently doesn't work:**
- Any AI that promises to book "the cheapest possible flights" without considering your actual preferences (usually suggests 6AM departures with two connections)
- Recommendation engines that can't access real-time pricing (prices often wrong by $100+)
- Chatbots that handle complex multi-city trips (they inevitably break down around the third destination)

## The 2026 verdict

Most AI travel tools remain stuck in the recommendation phase. They're excellent research assistants but poor booking agents. The platforms that combine AI search capabilities with human curation and actual booking power—like Otherwhere's text-based concierge service—are still rare but also the most useful.

If you want inspiration for where to go and specific restaurant recommendations in Barcelona's El Born district, the AI recommendation engines have never been better. If you want someone to actually book your American Airlines flight to Barcelona and text you the confirmation number, the landscape is much thinner.

The future probably isn't pure AI travel agents or traditional human ones. It's services that use AI to enhance human expertise rather than replace it entirely.
