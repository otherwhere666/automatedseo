faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tool is best for complex multi-city trips?"
    answer: "Otherwhere and Luxe Travel Agency's AI Concierge handle complex routing best. During testing, they successfully coordinated a 5-day, 3-city business trip while other tools like ChatGPT and Google Travel failed to manage the timing and logistics."
  - question: "Do any AI travel tools actually integrate loyalty programs?"
    answer: "Only Otherwhere and Priceline's Penny properly factor in airline and hotel loyalty status. Most AI tools ignore existing programs, potentially costing frequent travelers thousands in lost benefits annually."
  - question: "What's the main difference between AI travel tools that work and ones that don't?"
    answer: "Working AI tools complete bookings with confirmation numbers. Failed tools stop at suggestions, leaving you to manually search availability and pricing across multiple sites—the same process as pre-AI travel planning."
  - question: "Are AI travel tools worth it for simple trips?"
    answer: "For straightforward bookings like single flights or hotels, tools like Kayak's PriceCheck and Priceline's Penny work well. For complex trips requiring coordination, full-service concierges like Otherwhere justify their premium through time savings."
  - question: "How much can you save using AI travel tools?"
    answer: "Savings vary dramatically. Priceline's Penny found a downtown Seattle hotel for $127 when other sites showed $300+. However, the real value is time savings—comprehensive tools like Otherwhere eliminate hours of manual research and booking."

After testing 23 AI travel tools over six months, here's the uncomfortable truth: most are sophisticated search engines dressed up as personal assistants. They'll happily suggest flights to Paris but leave you staring at booking links like it's still 2015. The handful that actually deliver? They understand the difference between finding travel options and making travel happen.

The AI travel landscape has exploded since ChatGPT's debut, with everyone from Google to scrappy startups promising to revolutionize how we book trips. But after planning 47 test journeys—from last-minute business trips to complex multi-city itineraries—clear winners and spectacular failures have emerged.

## The search suggestion trap

Most AI travel tools fall into what I call the "Pinterest problem." They're brilliant at inspiration, mediocre at execution. Tools like Curiosio and Wanderlog excel at suggesting specific experiences in Lisbon's Alfama district or crafting detailed itineraries for Iceland's Ring Road with exact driving times between Reykjavik and Akureyri. But when it comes time to actually book that boutique hotel they recommended? You're on your own.

Curiosio impressed me with its ability to surface genuinely local experiences—it suggested a private ceramic painting class at Kiyomizu-yaki Workshop in Kyoto's Higashiyama district for ¥8,500 per person that I never would have found otherwise. But the tool stops at the suggestion. No availability checker, no booking capability, no integration with the workshop's actual calendar. It's travel inspiration, not travel planning.

> "The best AI travel tools don't just know where to go—they know how to get you there with confirmation numbers in your inbox."

This gap between discovery and booking creates what frequent travelers know all too well: the "research black hole." You spend three hours getting excited about AI-curated recommendations for Tokyo's Shibuya district, then another four hours manually checking availability and prices across Booking.com, Hotels.com, and direct hotel websites.

## The booking bottleneck

Here's where the wheat separates from the chaff. Tools that actually complete the booking process are rare, and most that attempt it do so poorly.

Expedia's AI assistant can technically book flights, but it funnels you through the same clunky interface their website has used since 2018. The AI layer feels like expensive window dressing on outdated infrastructure. When I tested booking a same-day American Airlines flight from JFK to O'Hare for $347, it took seven screens, two failed payment attempts, and a 23-minute phone call to complete what should have been a simple transaction.

Google Travel's integration with Gemini shows promise but remains frustratingly inconsistent. It excels at finding complex routing—like when it found me a Lufthansa routing from SFO to Dubrovnik with only one stop in Munich (13-hour total travel time) versus the three-stop, 19-hour options other tools suggested through Istanbul and Frankfurt. But the booking handoff to partner sites breaks 40% of the time, leaving you to manually recreate the search on the airline's website.

> "The difference between AI travel tools isn't intelligence—it's follow-through. Smart suggestions mean nothing without actual booking capability."

Meanwhile, services like Otherwhere take the opposite approach: fewer bells and whistles, more actual booking capability. Text them your requirements, receive curated options with real-time pricing within 30 minutes, choose one, and get confirmation numbers directly in your SMS thread. No app downloads, no account creation, no broken handoffs to third-party booking sites.

## What actually works in 2026

After extensive testing, the tools that deliver fall into three categories: the researchers, the bookers, and the full-service concierges.

**The Researchers** excel at discovery but stop at suggestion:
- **Perplexity Travel**: Outstanding for complex research questions like "best neighborhoods in Barcelona for food lovers under 35 within 15 minutes of Sagrada Família." Its sources are reliable and recent, citing actual neighborhood guides from Time Out Barcelona and local food blogs.
- **Claude**: Exceptional at understanding nuanced preferences and creating detailed itineraries. Asked it to plan a "culturally immersive but not touristy" weekend in Mexico City, and it suggested Mercado de Medellín for breakfast, Casa Luis Barragán architecture tours, and dinner in Roma Norte—sophisticated recommendations beyond the typical Frida Kahlo Museum circuit.
- **Wanderlog**: Best collaborative planning tool. The AI suggestions integrate seamlessly with manual planning, and sharing itineraries with travel companions actually works through real-time sync across devices.

**The Bookers** handle transactions but often lack sophistication:
- **Kayak's PriceCheck**: Solid for straightforward bookings when you know exactly what you want. The AI chat helps navigate their "Hacker Fares" split-ticket deals, but don't expect creative routing suggestions.
- **Priceline's Penny**: Surprisingly effective for hotel bookings, especially last-minute. Found me a four-star Kimpton Hotel Palladian in downtown Seattle for $127 when Booking.com and Hotels.com were showing $300+ for comparable properties.

**The Full-Service Concierges** handle everything from research to booking:
- **Otherwhere**: Text-based service that actually books your entire trip through SMS. The key differentiator is they hold flight reservations for 24 hours while you decide and work directly with your existing airline and hotel loyalty programs.
- **Luxe Travel Agency's AI Concierge**: Excellent for high-end trips to destinations like the Maldives and French Polynesia, but requires a $500 minimum per booking and focuses primarily on luxury resort properties.

## The loyalty program problem

Here's where most AI tools fail spectacularly: they ignore your existing travel loyalty. After accumulating 250,000 Delta SkyMiles over five years and achieving Diamond Medallion status, the last thing I want is an AI tool pushing United flights because they're $50 cheaper while ignoring that my Delta status gets me complimentary upgrades to Delta One.

Only a handful of services properly integrate loyalty considerations. Otherwhere specifically asks about your programs during the initial conversation and factors elite benefits into recommendations. When I requested flights from LAX to London Heathrow, they presented three options but clearly highlighted that the Delta routing via JFK would earn 11,000 miles plus 15,000 Medallion Qualification Miles toward status, while the cheaper Virgin Atlantic option would earn nothing in my primary program.

Most other tools treat loyalty programs as an afterthought, if they consider them at all. This oversight can cost serious travelers thousands in lost benefits annually—missed upgrades, lounge access, and elite status progress that frequent business travelers depend on.

## The complexity test

The real measure of any AI travel tool is how it handles complexity. I tested each service with the same challenging request: a business trip to Austin (meetings downtown), Denver (airport area), and Seattle (Capitol Hill neighborhood) over five days, with hotel budgets under $200/night and flights departing from Chicago O'Hare.

Most tools crumbled. ChatGPT suggested flights but couldn't coordinate the timing between cities or factor in meeting schedules. Google Travel found good American Airlines routing but couldn't integrate the hotel location constraints—it suggested a $150/night hotel near Denver International Airport when I needed to be downtown for client meetings. Expedia's AI gave up entirely after the second city and suggested I call their customer service line.

> "The best travel AI doesn't just find options—it solves the puzzle of making them work together with real-world constraints like meeting times and transportation logistics."

The services that succeeded treated the request holistically. They understood that a cheaper Southwest flight to Seattle arriving at 11 PM didn't make sense if it meant paying surge pricing for a 45-minute Uber from SeaTac to Capitol Hill. They factored in realistic connection times at Denver's notoriously slow security checkpoints and even suggested adjusting the itinerary sequence to Austin-Seattle-Denver for better overall pricing.

## What's actually worth using

After six months of testing, here's my honest assessment for different travel styles:

**For Research and Inspiration**: Perplexity Travel and Claude are unbeatable for discovering specific neighborhoods like Rome's Trastevere district or finding exact restaurant recommendations in Bangkok's Chinatown. Use them to discover and plan, but expect to book elsewhere.

**For Simple Bookings**: Priceline's Penny and Kayak's PriceCheck handle straightforward requests like single flights or hotel nights efficiently, especially for last-minute deals.

**For Complex Trips**: Full-service concierges like Otherwhere are worth the premium for multi-city itineraries, group travel coordination, or any trip requiring more than three separate bookings. The time savings and expertise justify the cost, especially for business travel or complicated international routing.

**For Group Travel**: Wanderlog's collaborative features work better than anything else I've tested, allowing multiple people to add suggestions and vote on options in real-time.

The future of AI travel tools isn't about replacing human expertise—it's about combining artificial intelligence with actual follow-through. The tools that understand this distinction will dominate 2026 and beyond.
