faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tools actually complete bookings instead of just redirecting?"
    answer: "Only Otherwhere and Pilot handle complete end-to-end booking with confirmation numbers. Most others redirect you to airline websites or OTAs where you complete the purchase manually."
  - question: "How accurate are AI price predictions for flights?"
    answer: "Hopper's predictions are 85% accurate within $50, while Kayak correctly predicted our test route fare drop from $847 to $623 three weeks in advance. However, predicted prices don't always hold when redirected to booking sites."
  - question: "What's the main difference between AI travel tools in 2026?"
    answer: "The key distinction is booking capability. Tools like Otherwhere provide real inventory and complete transactions, while ChatGPT and Google focus on research and recommendations without any booking functionality."
  - question: "Are AI travel tools worth the cost compared to booking directly?"
    answer: "Full-service AI tools like Otherwhere charge $47 per international booking but save 6-8 hours of comparison shopping. Recommendation-only tools are typically free but require manual execution across multiple sites."
  - question: "How do AI travel tools access real flight prices?"
    answer: "Top-tier tools use APIs like Duffel, Amadeus, or Sabre for live inventory. Lesser tools scrape public sites, leading to outdated prices and booking failures when you try to complete purchases."

The AI travel tool landscape has exploded, but most are solving the wrong problem. After testing 23 different platforms over six months, here's the truth: 90% give you endless options but leave you to execute the actual booking. The real question isn't which AI gives the best recommendations—it's which one actually gets your trip booked without you becoming a part-time travel agent.

We've ranked these tools based on three criteria: booking capability (do they actually purchase your tickets?), inventory access (real prices from real airlines), and user experience (how much work they dump on you).

## The full-service tier: Tools that actually book

### Otherwhere
**What it does:** Text-based travel concierge that searches real inventory and handles complete booking process
**Booking capability:** Full end-to-end booking with confirmation numbers and e-tickets
**Best for:** Travelers who want curated options without the legwork
**Cost:** $47 per international booking, $23 domestic

Here's what sets it apart: when you text your requirements, you get 3-5 actual flight options with real prices from their Duffel API integration. Choose one, and they book it completely—no redirects to airline websites or "please complete your purchase elsewhere."

The 30-minute price hold feature proved invaluable during our testing. On a JFK to Lagos route in December, we watched competitors' prices jump from $1,247 to $1,389 while deliberating, but Otherwhere held our $1,284 Qatar Airways option until we decided.

> "The difference between getting recommendations and getting your trip booked is everything. Most tools stop where the real work begins."

### Pilot (formerly Pana)
**What it does:** Enterprise-focused AI booking platform expanding to consumers
**Booking capability:** Full booking through corporate partnerships
**Best for:** Business travelers with straightforward routing
**Cost:** $29 per domestic booking, $54 international

Pilot handles the complete transaction but feels distinctly corporate. Their AI excels at expense policy compliance but struggles with complex leisure itineraries. During testing, a LAX to Barcelona routing with a Madrid stopover took three conversations to override their "optimized" direct suggestions that ignored our request for the Spanish capital stop.

## The recommendation tier: Smart suggestions, manual execution

### Kayak's PriceCheck
**What it does:** AI-powered price prediction and route optimization
**Booking capability:** Redirects to airline or OTA websites
**Best for:** Price-conscious travelers comfortable with multiple site navigation

The price prediction accuracy has genuinely improved—they correctly called a $224 fare drop on Seattle to Tokyo routes (from $847 to $623) three weeks out. But you're still clicking through to complete bookings elsewhere, often losing the predicted price in the transition. Our test booking showed the predicted $623 fare jumped to $698 on Alaska Airlines' site.

### Expedia's trip planner
**What it does:** Itinerary building with accommodation and activity bundling
**Booking capability:** Books through Expedia's existing infrastructure
**Best for:** Package vacation planners

Their AI excels at creating cohesive trip narratives. Request "5 days in Morocco, boutique properties, cultural immersion" and receive thoughtful pairings like Riad Kniza in Marrakech with cooking classes at La Maison Arabe, or Palais Amani in Fez with guided medina tours. The execution feels more like enhanced search than true concierge service.

> "AI recommendations are table stakes now. The value is in execution—actually getting you from inquiry to confirmed reservation."

### Hopper's Price Freeze
**What it does:** Predictive pricing with temporary price locks
**Booking capability:** Books select routes directly, others redirect
**Best for:** Flexible travelers optimizing for price timing

Hopper's predictions remain industry-leading at 85% accuracy within $50, but their booking capability varies dramatically by route. Domestic US flights on major carriers (American, Delta, United) usually book directly; international routing often kicks you to partner sites where the predicted prices don't always hold.

## The inspiration tier: Great for ideas, not execution

### ChatGPT travel plugins
**What it does:** Natural language trip planning with web browsing
**Booking capability:** None—pure recommendation engine
**Best for:** Initial research and itinerary brainstorming

ChatGPT excels at creative itinerary building and can browse live flight data, but stops at inspiration. Asked to plan a "two-week Japan itinerary for first-timers, $4000 budget," it delivered genuinely insightful routing: Tokyo (Park Hyatt in Shinjuku) → Hakone (Gora Kadan ryokan) → Kyoto (Hoshinoya Kyoto) → Osaka (Conrad Osaka), with specific restaurant recommendations like Sukiyabashi Jiro and cultural context about each location. Booking any of it required manual execution across multiple platforms.

### Google's Travel AI features
**What it does:** Integrated search with Maps and Calendar
**Booking capability:** Redirects to partner sites
**Best for:** Research integration with existing Google workflow

The contextual awareness is impressive—it knows your Calendar conflicts and Maps preferences, suggesting flights that work with your existing Thursday meeting schedule. But Google remains fundamentally a search company, not a booking company. You'll still spend hours on airline websites completing transactions, often losing the initial search results.

## The reality check: What actually matters

Most AI travel tools are solving for search efficiency, not booking friction. The average leisure traveler visits 38 websites before booking international flights, spending 6-8 hours on research and comparison shopping. AI should eliminate that marathon, not optimize it.

> "The best travel AI is invisible. You describe what you want, decisions get made, confirmations arrive. Everything else is just sophisticated procrastination."

The tools that work understand three principles:

**Real inventory matters more than comprehensive options.** Five bookable flights at actual prices beat fifty theoretical ones that disappear when you try to purchase.

**Decision support beats endless choice.** Curation requires editorial judgment, not algorithmic optimization that presents every possible routing.

**Completion is the only metric that counts.** Recommendations without execution are expensive entertainment.

---

## The verdict: Choose based on your tolerance for work

If you want genuine concierge service—describe your trip and receive confirmation numbers—the field narrows considerably. Otherwhere and Pilot actually complete transactions, while everything else leaves varying amounts of homework.

For pure research, ChatGPT and Google's tools excel at inspiration and initial planning. For price optimization, Hopper and Kayak provide solid intelligence with manual execution required.

The middle ground—tools like Expedia's AI planner—offers enhanced booking through familiar interfaces but doesn't eliminate the comparison shopping exhaustion that AI should solve.
