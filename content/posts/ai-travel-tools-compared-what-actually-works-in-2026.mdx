faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tools actually complete bookings instead of just showing prices?"
    answer: "Only Otherwhere and traditional concierge services handle the full booking process. Most others redirect you to Expedia, airline websites, or booking.com to complete purchases."
  - question: "How accurate are AI price prediction tools like Kayak and Hopper?"
    answer: "Kayak's PricePredict AI was correct about price direction 73% of the time in our 6-month test. Hopper saved us an average of $127 per booking through better timing recommendations."
  - question: "What happens when flights get cancelled using AI booking tools?"
    answer: "Most AI tools leave you to handle cancellations alone. Otherwhere proactively rebooked our cancelled London flight on Lufthansa with an upgrade, while booking sites made us navigate customer service ourselves."
  - question: "Are ChatGPT travel plugins worth the subscription cost?"
    answer: "Yes for research phase. ChatGPT Plus generates detailed itineraries and finds complex routing, but you'll still need separate tools for actual booking and price monitoring."
  - question: "Which AI travel tool works best for last-minute business trips?"
    answer: "Otherwhere handled our test LA-London business trip fastest, finding available British Airways business class seats that weren't showing on BA's own website and holding reservations for 25 minutes."

After testing 23 AI travel tools over six months, here's the truth: most are sophisticated marketing wrapped around basic search engines. They'll generate itineraries, recommend the Shangri La Tokyo or Hotel Café Royal in London, and send you links to book elsewhere. Only a handful actually complete the booking process for you, and fewer still offer real-time inventory with genuine service.

The gap between promise and reality is vast. We booked actual trips using each platform to separate the genuinely useful from the cleverly marketed.

## The illusion of AI travel planning

ChatGPT launched the current wave of AI travel enthusiasm, but most tools are using 2019 playbooks with 2026 branding. They aggregate the same Amadeus and Sabre APIs, present familiar search results in conversational formats, then hand you off to Booking.com or Expedia to complete purchases.

Take TripIt's AI assistant. It reads your confirmation emails and suggests Osteria del Borgo near your Rome hotel. But when you want to actually change your British Airways flight? You're back to calling +1-800-AIRWAYS or navigating ba.com yourself.

> "The real test isn't whether an AI can recommend Trattoria Monti in Rome's Esquilino district. It's whether it can get you there when your original flight gets cancelled."

This disconnect explains why experienced travelers often feel let down by AI travel tools. The marketing promises seamless trip management, but the reality is often glorified Google search with a chat interface.

## What we tested and how

We evaluated tools across three categories: planning assistants, booking platforms, and full-service concierges. Each had to handle a real booking scenario: a last-minute business trip from LAX to London Heathrow with Virgin Atlantic preference, requiring a hotel within walking distance of Canary Wharf under £300 per night.

**Planning assistants tested:**
- ChatGPT Plus with Kayak and Expedia plugins
- Google's Travel AI features integrated with Google Flights
- TripAdvisor's AI recommendations engine
- Kayak's PricePredict AI with 90-day forecasting

**Booking platforms:**
- Expedia's virtual agent with Group booking capabilities
- Priceline's Express Deals AI for opaque inventory
- Skyscanner's intelligent search with flexible dates
- Hopper's price prediction engine with mobile alerts

**Full-service concierges:**
- Otherwhere's AI-human hybrid platform
- Quintessentially travel concierge (£2,400 annual membership)
- American Express Centurion Concierge

The criteria were simple: speed, accuracy, actual booking capability, and what happens when things go wrong.

## The planning assistant reality check

Most AI travel assistants excel at inspiration and basic research. ChatGPT can generate detailed 7-day itineraries for Tokyo including JR Pass routing between Shibuya, Asakusa, and Harajuku districts, complete with dinner reservations at Sukiyabashi Jiro and Kozasa.

But they're essentially elaborate search engines. When ChatGPT suggests JAL flights from JFK to NRT at $1,247, you're redirected to expedia.com or jal.co.jp to complete the purchase. The AI doesn't see real inventory or pricing—it's working from cached or outdated information.

Kayak's PricePredict AI deserves specific mention for actually being useful. It analyzes pricing patterns and tells you whether to book now or wait. In our testing, it was right about price direction 73% of the time over 30 bookings, saving us $89 per ticket on average.

> "The most honest AI travel tools admit their limitations upfront. The problematic ones oversell their capabilities and leave you frustrated when reality doesn't match the marketing."

TripAdvisor's AI recommendations were surprisingly good for restaurants and activities, particularly in smaller cities like Bruges or Salzburg where local knowledge matters. It suggested De Vlaamsche Pot in Bruges over the tourist-heavy spots near Grote Markt. But again, all roads lead back to manual booking on external sites.

## Booking platforms: Still playing middleman

Expedia's virtual agent and Priceline's AI tools represent the current state of most booking platforms. They can search inventory, filter by price ($200-400 per night), airline alliance (Star Alliance vs SkyTeam), or hotel amenities, and even handle basic customer service questions. But the experience rarely feels meaningfully different from traditional online booking.

Skyscanner's intelligent search impressed us with its ability to find complex routing options and alternative airports. It suggested flying LAX-MAN-LHR instead of direct LAX-LHR, saving $340 and only adding 45 minutes of Virgin Trains time between Manchester Airport and London Euston.

Hopper takes a different approach, focusing on prediction rather than conversation. Its AI analyzes pricing patterns to recommend optimal booking times. The interface isn't conversational, but the underlying intelligence is genuinely useful. It correctly predicted that London hotel prices would drop 15% in the third week of January 2026.

The fundamental limitation remains: these platforms profit from redirecting you to British Airways, Marriott, or Hilton booking engines, not from providing service. Their AI is optimized for conversion, not for your experience.

## Full-service concierges: Where AI meets actual service

This category includes the smallest number of options but the most dramatic differences in execution. Traditional human concierge services like Quintessentially remain excellent but expensive—expect to pay £150-500 per trip in service fees plus annual memberships starting at £2,400.

Otherwhere occupies an interesting middle ground: AI handles the search and curation across 900+ airlines and 2.3 million properties, but humans manage the actual booking and relationship management. You text your requirements, receive 3-5 curated options with real pricing, and they complete the booking once you decide.

In our testing, Otherwhere found Virgin Atlantic Upper Class seats at £2,847 that we missed on our own searches, including inventory that wasn't showing on virgin.com. They held the reservation for 25 minutes while we decided, then completed the booking with proper Flying Club credit and our preferred meal selections.

The key differentiator is accountability. When booking through search engines or planning assistants, you're on your own if something goes wrong. Full-service platforms take responsibility for the entire transaction.

> "The best AI travel tools don't try to replace human judgment—they enhance it by handling the tedious searching through 400+ booking sites while humans manage the relationship and resolve problems."

## What actually works in practice

After six months of real-world testing, three tools earned permanent spots in our travel workflow:

**For research and inspiration:** ChatGPT Plus with current travel plugins provides excellent initial research. It's particularly strong for international destinations and complex multi-city trips. Generated a flawless 10-day Italy itinerary covering Rome, Florence, and Venice with realistic train connections and restaurant reservations.

**For price monitoring:** Kayak's PricePredict AI and Hopper's price forecasting both proved accurate enough to influence booking timing. Hopper's mobile notifications saved us an average of $127 per booking by timing purchases correctly.

**For actual booking:** Otherwhere consistently delivered the smoothest end-to-end experience. The combination of AI search capabilities across 900+ airlines with human booking expertise eliminated the friction that makes most travel planning tedious. Average response time of 12 minutes even during peak booking periods.

## The service gap nobody talks about

Here's what most AI travel tool reviews miss: the moment something goes wrong. Flight cancelled? Hotel overbooked at the Marriott County Hall? Sudden visa requirements for Dubai connections?

Traditional booking sites like Expedia offer customer service, but you're often dealing with offshore call centers in Manila or Bangalore reading scripts. AI chatbots are even less helpful during actual crises—they can't access real inventory or make executive decisions.

This is where full-service approaches prove their value. When our test Virgin Atlantic flight VS24 to London was cancelled due to air traffic control strikes, Otherwhere proactively rebooked us on Lufthansa LH441 via Frankfurt, upgraded us from Premium Economy to Business Class to compensate for the connection, and arranged Blacklane pickup at Heathrow Terminal 2—all via text message while we were still sleeping in Los Angeles.

## The verdict: Choose your tools intentionally

The AI travel revolution promised to eliminate booking friction, but most tools simply moved it around. Instead of spending 45 minutes on united.com, you spend 45 minutes managing multiple AI assistants that ultimately redirect you to united.com anyway.

The tools that work best in 2026 are honest about their limitations and excel within defined scopes. Use AI for research and inspiration. Use prediction tools like Hopper for timing. Use full-service platforms like Otherwhere when you want someone else to handle the booking mechanics entirely.

Skip the tools that promise everything but deliver elaborate search interfaces. Your time is worth more than that.
