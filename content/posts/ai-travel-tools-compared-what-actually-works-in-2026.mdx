faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tools can actually book flights, not just search for them?"
    answer: "Most AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard only provide research and recommendations. Only full-service platforms like Expedia's virtual agent and concierge services like Otherwhere can complete actual bookings with confirmation numbers."
  - question: "How accurate are AI flight price predictions in 2026?"
    answer: "FlightAware's AI disruption predictions are highly accurate, correctly predicting cancellations 6+ hours early. However, general price predictions from Google Bard are often hours or days outdated, with 60% of recommended flights already sold out during our testing."
  - question: "What's the biggest limitation of current travel AI tools?"
    answer: "They're optimized for conversation, not completion. Most can endlessly discuss your trip options but require you to manually book everything yourself across multiple platforms."
  - question: "Are AI-powered travel tools better than traditional booking sites?"
    answer: "For research and price comparison, yes. For actual booking, hybrid services that combine AI search with human execution (like Otherwhere) outperform both pure AI tools and traditional sites."
  - question: "Do AI travel tools really save money on bookings?"
    answer: "Mixed results. Skyscanner's AI saved us £340 by suggesting Prague over Vienna routing, but dynamic packaging across all AI platforms consistently cost more than booking flights and hotels separately."

After testing seventeen different AI travel tools over six months, I can tell you this: most are sophisticated marketing engines wrapped around the same basic search results. The real question isn't which AI can generate the most travel content—it's which ones can actually get you from search to boarding pass without losing your sanity or your money.

The landscape has shifted dramatically since 2024. What started as a race to build the smartest chatbot has evolved into something more nuanced: the question of whether you want a research assistant or someone who can actually book your trip.

## The chatbot generation: Smart but shallow

OpenAI's travel planning capabilities have improved significantly, but they're still fundamentally limited by their training cutoff. Ask ChatGPT about flights from New York to Tokyo next month, and you'll get thoughtful advice about airlines, routing options, and seasonal considerations. You won't get actual prices, availability, or the ability to book anything.

Google's Bard (now integrated into Gemini) suffers from a similar problem despite having real-time web access. It can find flight prices—showing Delta at $847 or ANA at $923 for JFK-NRT routes—but the information is often hours or days old. When I tested it for a last-minute booking to London, three of the five flights it recommended were already sold out by the time I clicked through to book.

Perplexity AI has carved out an interesting niche here. Its travel search feels more like having a research librarian who specializes in travel—it'll cite sources, compare options across multiple sites, and present information clearly. It correctly identified that Hotel Café Royal in London's Regent Street was £180 cheaper when booked directly versus through Booking.com. But again, you're getting research, not reservations.

## Platform plays: When apps meet artificial intelligence

Kayak's AI integration feels like the most natural evolution of existing tools. Their PriceCheck feature can analyze flight screenshots and tell you if you're getting a good deal—it flagged a $1,247 business class fare to Amsterdam as "$340 above average" while confirming a $420 economy ticket was "excellent value." Their chatbot handles basic queries well, though it tends to funnel you back to their standard search interface for anything complex.

Expedia's virtual agent has gotten surprisingly sophisticated. It can handle multi-city trips, factor in Marriott Bonvoy preferences, and even suggest Din Tai Fung locations near your Shibuya hotel. The problem is execution: three times during testing, it suggested bookings that weren't actually available when I tried to complete them—including a "confirmed available" room at Park Hyatt Tokyo that had been sold out for two days.

Skyscanner's AI features focus heavily on price prediction and alternative suggestions. Their "Everywhere" search powered by AI recommendations genuinely helped me discover routing options I wouldn't have considered—like flying to Prague instead of Vienna for a trip to Central Europe, saving £340 in the process by suggesting Czech Airlines via PRG rather than Austrian Airlines direct to VIE.

## The concierge category: Where AI meets human service

This is where things get interesting. A new category of services has emerged that uses AI for the heavy lifting but maintains human oversight for the actual booking process.

Mezi tried this approach early but never quite solved the handoff between AI and human agents. Their chatbot would collect requirements for a Rome itinerary beautifully, then you'd wait 6-8 hours for a human to respond with options that often missed the mark—suggesting Hotel de Russie at €850/night when you'd specified a €300 budget.

Otherwhere represents what feels like the evolved version of this model. Text them your requirements, and you get curated options with real prices within minutes. More importantly, they actually book everything for you once you decide—no screenshots, no "click here to complete," no wondering if your seat selection went through.

I tested this with a complex family trip to Japan: four people, two cities (Tokyo and Kyoto), specific requirements for connecting rooms at properties near train stations, and United MileagePlus status to consider. Within thirty minutes, I had three complete itinerary options with accurate pricing—including ANA flights with economy premium seats and confirmed connecting rooms at Andaz Tokyo Toranomon Hills and The Ritz-Carlton Kyoto. Within an hour of choosing the $8,340 total package, I had confirmation numbers and boarding passes.

## The specialized tools worth knowing about

For flight tracking and rebooking, nothing beats FlightAware's AI-powered disruption predictions. During the winter storm chaos at Chicago O'Hare in December 2025, it correctly predicted my United 1247 cancellation six hours before the airline sent notifications, giving me time to rebook proactively on the 6:45am departure while seats were still available.

TripIt's AI timeline feature has become genuinely helpful for complex itineraries. It doesn't just organize your confirmations—it actively suggests optimizations like requesting 2pm check-in at Conrad Istanbul based on your 11:30am Turkish Airlines arrival, or flagging that your 8pm reservation at Nusr-Et conflicts with a two-hour delayed connection from Frankfurt.

For corporate travel, TravelPerk's AI expense categorization saves hours during expense reporting. It learns your patterns and automatically tagged my $127 dinner at Zuma Dubai as "client entertainment" while correctly categorizing the $43 airport WiFi as "travel technology expense."

## What doesn't work (yet)

Dynamic packaging remains a mess across all platforms. Every AI tool promises to combine flights and hotels intelligently, but the math rarely works out better than booking separately. Testing a week in Barcelona, AI-suggested packages averaged $2,840 while booking the same ANA flights ($680) and Hotel Casa Fuster ($220/night) separately totaled $2,220.

Restaurant recommendations from travel AI are universally terrible. Ask for dinner spots in Rome's Trastevere, and you'll get the same tired list: Da Enzo al 29, Flavio al Velavevodetto, and Glass Hostaria—ignoring newer places like Checchino dal 1887 or local favorites that aren't SEO-optimized. Google Maps remains superior for this.

Most AI tools are also surprisingly bad at understanding budget constraints. Specify $3,000 for a week in Europe, and they'll show you options ranging from $1,200 hostels in Prague to $5,800 luxury packages in Switzerland without acknowledging the disconnect or explaining why they exceeded your stated budget.

## The verdict: What actually moves the needle

The tools that work solve a specific problem completely rather than trying to be everything to everyone. Kayak's price analysis tool works because it does one thing well—telling you if $847 for JFK-NRT is fair market value. FlightAware's disruption predictions work because they're based on real operational data from air traffic control systems, not general weather patterns.

The most significant development isn't in any single tool—it's in services that use AI to enhance human expertise rather than replace it. The combination of AI-powered search with human booking and oversight, like what Otherwhere offers, feels like the sustainable middle ground between endless self-service and expensive traditional agencies charging $150 per booking fee.

For most travelers, the winning combination in 2026 is using AI tools for research and inspiration, then having someone who can actually execute the booking efficiently. The technology has gotten sophisticated enough to surface great options quickly—finding that Prague routing or identifying Hotel Café Royal's direct booking discount—but the booking process itself remains too important to leave entirely to algorithms.
