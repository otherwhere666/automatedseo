faqs:
  - question: "Which AI travel tools can actually complete bookings?"
    answer: "Only Otherwhere and Mezi (Amex Platinum only) can complete end-to-end bookings. Most others redirect you to external booking sites."
  - question: "How much do AI travel booking services cost?"
    answer: "Otherwhere charges $49 per booking for flights and hotels. Mezi is free for Amex Platinum cardholders. Research-only tools like Perplexity cost $20/month."
  - question: "Can AI tools handle complex multi-city trips?"
    answer: "Most fail at complex itineraries. Otherwhere and Claude with plugins handle multi-city requests best, while Kayak and Expedia break on anything beyond simple roundtrips."
  - question: "Do AI travel tools have access to real-time flight prices?"
    answer: "Only services with direct airline API access show real-time prices. Consumer tools like Wanderlog show cached prices that can be hours or days old."
  - question: "Are AI travel recommendations better than human travel agents?"
    answer: "For research and cultural context, yes. Claude provides better local insights than most agents. But human agents still excel at complex group bookings and crisis management."

The AI travel revolution promised to end booking headaches forever. Three years later, most tools still can't book a simple roundtrip flight without sending you down a rabbit hole of apps, links, and broken promises. We tested 15 AI travel platforms to see what actually works—and what's just expensive marketing wrapped around the same old booking frustrations.

The verdict? Most are glorified search engines with chatbot interfaces. But a select few are genuinely changing how we book travel.

## The great AI travel tool reckoning

Remember when AI was supposed to make travel planning effortless? The reality is messier. After testing everything from venture-backed startups to Google's travel AI, the pattern is clear: most tools excel at recommendations but fail spectacularly at execution.

Take Wanderlog's AI trip planner. It suggests staying at the Park Hyatt Tokyo in Shinjuku for ¥85,000 per night, recommends dinner at Sukiyabashi Jiro for ¥40,000, and maps out a perfect 5-day Tokyo itinerary. But try to book that Park Hyatt room? You're bounced to Booking.com, Expedia, and three other tabs. The AI stops helping exactly when you need it most.

> "The best AI travel tools solve the entire problem, not just the pretty part at the beginning."

ChatGPT Plus with browsing enabled actually performs better than most dedicated travel tools for research. Ask it to find direct flights from Chicago to Reykjavik under $600 in March, and you'll get current Icelandair prices at $547 and United at $589. But again—no booking capability.

## What actually works: The tier system

After weeks of testing, the tools fall into three clear categories: search engines in disguise, genuine assistants, and the rare few that actually complete transactions.

## Tier 1: Pretty but pointless

These tools nail the demo but crumble under real-world use:

- **Kayak's AI assistant**: Great at finding American Airlines flights from LAX to Miami for $312, terrible at complex requests. Asked it to find flights avoiding United due to status challenges with Star Alliance—it couldn't understand the concept of airline loyalty conflicts.

- **Expedia's virtual agent**: Impressive natural language processing, but it's essentially a fancy filter system. Request a multi-city trip from Seattle to Barcelona with 3 nights, then Rome for 4 nights, returning from Athens—it breaks completely and defaults to basic roundtrip search.

- **TripIt's AI features**: Excellent for organizing existing Delta confirmation PQR789 and Marriott reservation MR123456, useless for creating new bookings.

## Tier 2: Genuinely helpful assistants

These tools provide real value but stop short of booking:

- **Perplexity AI with travel mode**: Outstanding research capability. Ask about visa requirements for US citizens visiting India, UAE, and Thailand in a single month, and you'll get current e-visa processing times (72 hours for India, visa-on-arrival for UAE, 30-day exempt for Thailand) that most travel agents would charge $200 to compile.

- **Claude with travel plugins**: Surprisingly good at building detailed itineraries with realistic timing and local insight. Recommended taking the 6:45 AM train from Rome Termini to Florence Santa Maria Novella (1h 32m, €29 in standard class) instead of flying—better cultural context than most human agents.

- **Layla AI**: The only chatbot that consistently understood complex family travel requirements. Impressed us by suggesting Osteria alle Testiere in Venice's Castello district for dinner with kids—not in any guidebook but serves early seating at 6 PM perfect for families, with fresh seafood that even picky eaters enjoy.

> "The gap between AI recommendations and actual booking is where most travelers get lost—and frustrated."

## Tier 3: End-to-end execution

This category has exactly two players worth mentioning:

**Otherwhere** stands out because it's the only service that actually completes the booking process. Text them your requirements, get 3-5 curated options with real prices from live inventory, pick one, and they handle everything else. You receive actual confirmation numbers like UA789PQR and Lufthansa RBKM7X, not links to other booking sites.

We tested this with a complicated request: business class flights for two from San Francisco to Istanbul with a 4-day stopover in Amsterdam, departing in 6 weeks. Most AI tools either couldn't understand the request or provided outdated pricing showing Turkish Airlines business class at $3,200 (actually $4,100). Otherwhere returned three viable options within an hour—Lufthansa via Munich at $3,850, KLM direct to Amsterdam then Turkish to Istanbul at $3,650, and Emirates via Dubai at $4,200—held our preferred KLM choice for 30 minutes while we decided, then booked it completely.

**Mezi** (now part of American Express) offers similar end-to-end service but only for Amex Platinum cardholders. The AI successfully booked us on Delta One from JFK to London Heathrow at $5,200, but availability is frustratingly limited to Amex's preferred suppliers.

## The booking gap problem

Here's what separates useful AI travel tools from expensive demos: inventory access and transaction capability. Most consumer-facing AI tools can't actually see real-time availability for that Emirates A380 first-class suite or complete purchases from Singapore Airlines' KrisFlyer awards inventory. They're sophisticated front-ends for the same search engines you could use directly.

Services like Otherwhere work because they plug into actual airline inventory systems via APIs like Amadeus, Sabre, and Duffel, and can hold seats while you decide. That 30-minute hold feature sounds minor until you're trying to coordinate Qatar Airways Qsuites for two people on the Doha-London route during peak summer season.

The technical difference matters more than marketing suggests. Real inventory access means seeing that United has 2 business class seats available on flight UA901 at $4,200 each, versus cached data showing last week's pricing at $3,800 for seats that no longer exist.

## What to look for in 2026

The AI travel landscape is consolidating quickly. Tools without genuine booking capability are struggling to justify their existence when free alternatives like ChatGPT provide better research.

Here's what separates genuinely useful AI travel services:

- **Transaction completion**: Can it actually book that Cathay Pacific first-class seat it recommends?
- **Live inventory access**: Are those Singapore Airlines Suites prices real-time or cached from yesterday?
- **Complex request handling**: Can it manage multi-city trips, specific requests like avoiding Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, or crediting flights to Star Alliance partners?
- **Human backup**: When AI fails to find availability on Emirates' A380 first class, can you reach an actual person who knows about waitlists?

Most importantly, the best tools respect your existing travel relationships. If you're 15,000 miles from United Premier Gold status, an AI tool that consistently books you on Delta SkyMiles flights isn't intelligent—it's counterproductive.

## The verdict

AI has genuinely improved travel research and planning. Tools like Perplexity can compile destination information—current COVID-19 entry requirements for Japan, seasonal cherry blossom timing in Kyoto's Maruyama Park, rush hour patterns for Tokyo's Yamanote Line—that would take hours to research manually. Claude can build detailed itineraries that account for the 45-minute transfer between Rome's Fiumicino Airport and Termini Station, local customs around dining times in Spain, and seasonal considerations better than most guidebooks.

But for actual booking? The field narrows dramatically. Most AI travel tools are sophisticated marketing for traditional booking engines. The few that actually complete transactions—like Otherwhere—represent what AI travel service should be: helpful throughout the entire process, not just the attractive research phase.

The future probably belongs to services that combine AI research capabilities with actual booking power and access to consolidated inventory from multiple airlines and hotel chains. Until then, choose tools based on what they actually deliver, not what they promise to deliver.
