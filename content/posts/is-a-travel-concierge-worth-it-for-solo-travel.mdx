faqs:
  - question: "How much does a travel concierge typically cost?"
    answer: "Professional travel concierge services range from £50-200 per trip, depending on complexity. Services like Otherwhere often charge £75-150 for European city breaks including full booking and change management."
  - question: "Can a travel concierge help with last-minute bookings?"
    answer: "Yes, many travel concierges excel at last-minute bookings (24-72 hours notice) because they have access to industry inventory systems and can secure availability that consumer booking sites don't show."
  - question: "Will I lose my airline and hotel loyalty points using a concierge?"
    answer: "Reputable travel concierges book directly with hotels and airlines using your loyalty numbers. You retain all points, status benefits, and upgrade eligibility—they simply handle the booking process for you."
  - question: "What happens if my flight gets cancelled when using a concierge?"
    answer: "The concierge handles all rebooking, compensation claims, and coordination. While you're dealing with other priorities, they're already securing alternative flights and updating your hotel if arrival times change."
  - question: "How far in advance should I contact a travel concierge?"
    answer: "Most concierges work best with 2-4 weeks notice for optimal availability and pricing. However, services like Otherwhere can often deliver curated options within 24-48 hours for urgent travel needs."

Absolutely—but only if your hourly rate exceeds £75. Solo travelers typically spend 4-6 hours researching each trip, comparing flights across multiple carriers, cross-referencing hotel reviews on TripAdvisor and Booking.com, and navigating British Airways Executive Club versus Virgin Atlantic Flying Club redemption rates. A travel concierge eliminates this entirely, delivering curated options within 2-3 hours rather than spending your entire Saturday afternoon. The real question isn't whether it's worth it, but whether you can afford not to use one.

The mathematics are brutally simple when you calculate opportunity cost properly.

## The solo traveler's time trap

Solo travel planning is uniquely time-consuming because you can't delegate the decision-making. Unlike couples who might split research duties, or families where preferences are somewhat predictable, solo travelers bear the full cognitive load.

Consider Sarah, a management consultant I know who earns £150 per hour. She spent an entire Sunday morning—roughly 5 hours—planning a weekend in Barcelona. Cross-referencing British Airways flight times from Heathrow with Hotel Casa Fuster locations in Gràcia, reading through 47 reviews for the W Barcelona versus Hotel Omm in Eixample, comparing Avios redemptions against cash fares on Vueling.

> "I realised I'd just spent £750 worth of my time to save perhaps £200 on the booking. The math didn't add up."

The irony? She could have billed those 5 hours and easily afforded a travel concierge to handle everything, plus enjoyed better flight times and hotel selections curated by someone who books Barcelona trips weekly.

## When the numbers make sense

The break-even point is surprisingly low. If you value your time at £75+ per hour and typically spend 4+ hours planning each trip, a travel concierge pays for itself immediately.

But the calculation goes beyond pure hourly rates. Factor in:

• **Opportunity cost**: What else could you accomplish in those 4-6 hours?
• **Decision fatigue**: How much mental energy does endless comparison between 23 Marriott properties in Rome drain?
• **Booking anxiety**: The stress of wondering if you've found the best Heathrow-JFK route
• **Change management**: When British Airways cancels your connection through Madrid, who handles rebooking onto Virgin Atlantic?

A good travel concierge like Otherwhere doesn't just make recommendations—they actually book everything for you, handle changes, and provide real Amadeus confirmation numbers. You're not paying for advice; you're paying for execution.

## The solo travel premium problem

Solo travelers face unique challenges that couples or families don't encounter. Single supplements at properties like The Langham London add £180 per night, but boutique hotels like Zetter Townhouse Fitzrovia often waive these fees—knowledge that requires insider connections.

Flight connections become more critical when traveling alone. Miss your 55-minute connection at Frankfurt's Terminal 1, and there's no travel companion to help navigate Lufthansa rebooking while managing luggage. A travel concierge pre-empts these issues, selecting routing with 90+ minute connection times and backup options on partner airlines.

> "The best travel concierges think three moves ahead. They're not just booking your trip—they're anticipating what could go wrong and building in contingencies."

Consider loyalty program optimization. British Airways Executive Club members get different upgrade probabilities on LHR-JFK versus LHR-LAX routes. Marriott Bonvoy points vary from 12,500 at AC Hotel Portsmouth to 85,000 at The Ritz-Carlton London during peak season. Managing these nuances solo while comparing across multiple loyalty programs easily consumes 2-3 hours per trip.

## What you're actually buying

When you hire a travel concierge, you're purchasing several distinct services bundled together:

**Market intelligence**: They know Virgin Atlantic VS3 to New York faces consistent 45-minute delays, that Claridge's has lift renovation through March 2026, that Edinburgh hotel availability plummets during Festival Fringe in August.

**Inventory access**: Professional travel services often see British Airways Club World availability that ba.com doesn't display, particularly on popular routes like LHR-SIN or last-minute upgrades at Rosewood London.

**Risk management**: Flight delays, cancellations, overbookings—they handle the entire rebooking process while you're already exploring Covent Garden or dealing with client calls.

**Decision architecture**: Instead of presenting 31 hotel options in Marylebone, they curate 3-5 based on your stated preferences for quiet rooms, gym facilities, and proximity to Bond Street station.

The key differentiator is execution. Anyone can recommend The Savoy; fewer services will actually book it, secure your World of Hyatt benefits, request a Thames-view room, and provide real confirmation details.

## When to skip the concierge

Travel concierges aren't universally beneficial. Skip them if you genuinely enjoy spending Saturday mornings comparing Expedia versus Booking.com rates—some people find trip planning meditative or exciting rather than burdensome.

Also skip if you're extremely price-sensitive and willing to invest significant time for marginal savings. If you'll spend 8 hours comparing easyJet departure times to save £150 versus British Airways, and you consider that time well-spent, handle booking yourself.

Budget travelers under 30 often have more time than money, making the opportunity cost calculation different. But by your mid-30s, when career demands intensify and you're earning £70,000+ annually, the math typically flips.

> "The moment you start calculating your time in meaningful hourly increments, travel concierges become obvious value."

Finally, skip concierges for extremely simple trips—Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways with a straightforward Premier Inn booking, no loyalty program considerations or special requests.

## Choosing the right service

Not all travel concierges offer the same value proposition. Many provide recommendations but leave booking execution to you—defeating the primary purpose of saving time.

Look for services that handle end-to-end booking, provide real PNR confirmation numbers, and can hold inventory while you decide. Otherwhere, for example, can hold British Airways Club World seats for 30 minutes while you review options—crucial when premium availability disappears within hours on popular routes like LHR-DXB.

Ensure they respect existing loyalty program memberships rather than booking through their preferred partners exclusively. The best services optimise for your Avios earnings and Marriott Bonvoy elite benefits, not their commission relationships.

Pricing transparency matters enormously. Services that display £1,200 all-in for your LHR-JFK flight and Midtown Manhattan hotel rather than adding £150 service fees at checkout eliminate booking anxiety about final costs.

## Making the calculation

Start by honestly tracking your typical planning time per trip. Include initial research on Rome2Rio, comparison shopping across Kayak and Google Flights, reading Hotel Tonight reviews, checking Virgin Atlantic versus British Airways Flying Club redemption rates, and actual booking time across multiple sites.

Multiply by a realistic hourly value for your time. If you earn £80,000 annually, that's roughly £40 per hour, but your weekend time when you could be with family or pursuing personal projects might be worth £60-75 per hour to you.

Factor in stress reduction and cognitive load. If spending Tuesday evening comparing 17 different flight options affects your Wednesday morning client presentation, assign a monetary value to eliminating that distraction.

For most professionals earning £60,000+ annually, the mathematics favour using a travel concierge for anything beyond basic domestic trips.
