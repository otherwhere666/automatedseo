faqs:
  - question: "How much time does the average couple spend planning their honeymoon?"
    answer: "Our audit tracked couples spending 31-42 hours on average, with most research happening over 3-6 weeks. This includes flight comparisons, hotel research, and itinerary planning."
  - question: "Is using a travel concierge actually worth the cost?"
    answer: "For couples earning $50,000+ annually, yes. The opportunity cost of 30+ hours of research typically exceeds any savings achieved through DIY planning by $400-800."
  - question: "What information do I need to provide Otherwhere to start planning?"
    answer: "Just text us your destination, travel dates, approximate budget, and any specific preferences. We can work with flexible dates and will present 3-5 curated options within 24 hours."
  - question: "Can you work with my existing airline miles and hotel points?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We factor in your loyalty program benefits and can coordinate bookings to maximize your points and status benefits."

If you earn $75,000 annually, the 42 hours you'll spend researching honeymoon flights and hotels costs you $1,512 in opportunity time. That's before you factor in decision fatigue, browser crashes, or the inevitable 2 AM rabbit hole comparing Hotel Belmond Caruso versus Monastero Santa Rosa in Amalfi. For most professionals, the math is clear: your time is worth more than the marginal savings from DIY travel planning.

We audited five couples planning their honeymoons last month—tracking every minute spent researching versus the actual savings achieved. The results might surprise you.

## The hidden cost of honeymoon research

Sarah, a marketing director in San Francisco, spent 18 hours over three weeks planning her Amalfi Coast honeymoon. She opened 247 browser tabs (yes, we counted), bookmarked 31 hotels including Villa Cimbrone and Le Sirenuse, and created a color-coded spreadsheet comparing SFO-FCO flight times on Delta, United, and Lufthansa.

Her total savings from this research marathon? $340 compared to booking the Lufthansa flights and Villa San Michele she initially found on day one.

> "I realized I was spending more time planning the honeymoon than I spent planning the actual wedding. I had eight different spreadsheets for a five-day trip. Something had to give."

The pattern repeats across income levels. Tom, a software engineer earning $140,000, burned 38 hours researching Japan itineraries. His meticulous planning saved $580 on ANA flights—but cost him $2,534 in billable consulting time he could have earned instead.

This isn't about being lazy. It's about recognizing that travel research has become exponentially more complex in the last decade.

## Why honeymoon planning takes forever now

Remember when Expedia showed you three flight options? Now you're drowning in choice paralysis. The average traveler visits 22 websites before booking a single trip. For honeymoons—where stakes feel higher—that number jumps to 38.

The modern booking landscape includes:

- 15+ flight booking sites (Google Flights, Kayak, Momondo, Skiplagged) with different inventory
- Dynamic pricing that changes every 4-6 hours based on demand algorithms
- Hotel rates that vary by $200+ depending on whether you book through Booking.com, directly, or Amex Fine Hotels
- Reviews across TripAdvisor, Google, Yelp, and hotel-specific sites you feel obligated to cross-reference
- Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex points, and airline miles calculations that complicate every decision

Add wedding planning stress, and you get couples spending entire weekends refreshing flight prices on ITA Matrix instead of, well, enjoying their engagement.

Marcus, a consultant from Chicago, put it perfectly: "We delayed our honeymoon by three months because we kept second-guessing our bookings. Should we book the Park Hyatt or Grand Hotel Tremezzo? Delta direct or Swiss with the Zurich connection? The research became the enemy of actually traveling."

## The real hourly value calculation

Here's the math most people skip: your time has an opportunity cost, even during evenings and weekends.

If you earn $80,000 annually, your effective hourly rate is about $38. But travel research often happens during prime personal time—hours you could spend with your partner, pursuing hobbies, or taking on freelance work.

> "Once I calculated that my Sunday spent comparing Kayak versus Google Flights cost more than just booking the first decent option, everything clicked. I was earning $65 an hour at work and spending eight hours to save $180 on flights."

We tracked five couples through their entire booking process:

- **Average research time**: 31 hours per couple
- **Average savings achieved**: $420 compared to first viable option
- **Opportunity cost** (at $75k avg salary): $1,116
- **Net loss**: $696 per honeymoon

That's before factoring in stress, decision fatigue, or the relationship tension of endless "What do you think about this hotel?" conversations.

## When DIY makes sense (and when it doesn't)

Look, we're not anti-research. If you genuinely enjoy the planning process, have unlimited time, or you're booking a simple domestic trip, go wild.

DIY makes sense when:
- You're planning 6+ months ahead with flexible dates
- You have specific niche requirements (wheelchair accessibility, severe food allergies)
- Your total trip budget is under $3,000
- You genuinely find travel research relaxing and have 40+ hours to spare

But for most honeymoons—especially international trips with tight timelines—the math doesn't work.

Jennifer, a pediatrician earning $180,000, realized this mid-research: "I was using the same cognitive energy on comparing Rome hotel locations in Trastevere versus Campo de' Fiori that I use diagnosing patients. It was exhausting and frankly, a waste of my clinical training."

## The concierge alternative

This is where Otherwhere shifts the equation entirely. Instead of you spending 30+ hours researching, you text us your requirements. We search real inventory, present 3-5 curated options, and book everything once you decide.

The process takes about 20 minutes of your actual time.

Here's what happened when we planned Sarah's Amalfi Coast trip: She texted us on Tuesday with September dates and a $8,000 budget. We sent options Wednesday morning—three hotel choices (Belmond Hotel Caruso, Villa Cimbrone, and Palazzo Avino) with corresponding flight options on Lufthansa, Delta, and United. She picked Palazzo Avino with the Lufthansa connection through Munich over lunch. We had her confirmation numbers by 3 PM.

Total time invested: 18 minutes of text exchanges.

> "I kept waiting for the catch. There wasn't one. They just handled everything—even got me the room upgrade I would have been too nervous to ask for directly."

We respect your existing loyalty programs (Chase Sapphire, Amex Platinum, airline status), can hold flights while you decide, and pricing is transparent—no hidden fees lurking at checkout.

## The relationship dividend

Beyond the time savings, there's something else couples mention: reduced decision fatigue actually improves the honeymoon itself.

Tom and Lisa, who used Otherwhere for their Japan trip to Tokyo and Kyoto, put it best: "We arrived at Narita excited instead of exhausted. We'd been talking about Jiro's sushi and Fushimi Inari shrine for weeks instead of arguing about whether to book JAL or ANA, or the Park Hyatt Tokyo versus Aman."

When you're not burned out from planning, you show up differently. You're present for the actual experience instead of mentally checking off researched activities.

The best honeymoons aren't about finding the absolute cheapest flights on Scott's Cheap Flights. They're about creating space for connection after months of wedding chaos.

## The bottom line

If your time is worth more than $25/hour, the math favors delegation for complex trips like honeymoons. If it's worth more than $50/hour, it's not even close.

Your honeymoon deserves better than 247 browser tabs and decision paralysis. It deserves intentional planning that prioritizes experience over optimization.
