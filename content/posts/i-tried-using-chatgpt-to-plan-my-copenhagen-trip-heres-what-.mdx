faqs:
  - question: "Can ChatGPT book flights and hotels for travel?"
    answer: "No, ChatGPT cannot access real-time pricing or inventory systems. It can only provide general information and suggestions that you must verify and book separately."
  - question: "What are ChatGPT's main limitations for travel planning?"
    answer: "ChatGPT lacks real-time data access, cannot remember preferences between conversations, and cannot execute bookings. It's useful for brainstorming but not for actual travel execution."
  - question: "How much did flights to Copenhagen cost when researched?"
    answer: "SAS initially showed flights from LAX to CPH for $847, but prices changed during the booking process, highlighting the need for real-time pricing tools."
  - question: "What hotels did ChatGPT recommend in Copenhagen?"
    answer: "ChatGPT recommended Hotel Sanders and The Nimb, but couldn't verify availability or pricing for specific dates, requiring manual verification across multiple booking sites."
  - question: "What's the best approach to AI-powered travel planning?"
    answer: "Use ChatGPT for initial research and activity ideas, then switch to specialized travel AI services that can access real inventory and execute bookings with confirmed prices."

ChatGPT is brilliant at brainstorming travel ideas—it gave me thoughtful restaurant recommendations, museum hours, and even a day-by-day Copenhagen itinerary. But when it came time to actually book my trip, I hit a wall. ChatGPT couldn't check real flight prices, verify hotel availability, or remember my airline preferences from our previous conversation. What started as an exciting experiment in AI-powered travel planning quickly became a lesson in why you need purpose-built travel AI that can actually execute, not just ideate.

## The honeymoon phase: ChatGPT nails the brainstorming

My Copenhagen experiment began with high hopes. I asked ChatGPT to plan a four-day trip in October, mentioning I love design museums and good coffee. The response was genuinely impressive.

It suggested visiting the Designmuseum Danmark on Bredgade and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebæk (30 minutes north by train). For coffee, it recommended Atelier September on Gothersgade for their avocado toast and flat whites, plus Democratic Coffee on Krystalgade for single-origin beans from their in-house roastery. The AI even crafted a logical walking route connecting Nyhavn's colorful houses, the canals of Christianshavn, and the medieval streets around the University of Copenhagen.

> "ChatGPT excels at synthesizing information from across the internet, but it can't tell you if that boutique hotel actually has rooms available tonight."

The itinerary felt thoughtful, not generic. ChatGPT suggested exploring the street food scene at Refshaleøen's Reffen market and timing my Amalienborg Palace visit for the 12 PM changing of the guard ceremony. It even mentioned that Designmuseum Danmark stays open until 9 PM on Thursdays—details that showed genuine depth.

## Where the magic stops: The booking reality check

Then came the moment of truth: actually booking the trip. This is where ChatGPT's limitations became glaringly obvious.

When I asked for specific flight options, ChatGPT gave me airlines that fly the route—SAS, Lufthansa, KLM—but couldn't provide real prices or schedules. It suggested "checking directly with airlines" for current fares, essentially admitting it had no access to live booking data.

The hotel situation was worse. ChatGPT recommended Hotel Sanders on Tordenskjoldsgade and The Nimb at Tivoli Gardens, describing their Michelin-starred restaurants and historic architecture in detail. But when I asked about availability for my October dates, it defaulted to "I recommend checking their websites directly." No real-time inventory, no price comparisons, no booking capability.

**What ChatGPT couldn't do:**
- Check actual flight availability or prices
- Verify hotel room inventory for specific dates
- Remember my Star Alliance Gold status preferences
- Hold options while I decided between properties
- Actually book anything with confirmation numbers

## The authentication problem nobody talks about

Here's something that caught me off guard: ChatGPT has no memory between conversations. I spent twenty minutes explaining my travel preferences—aisle seats, Marriott Bonvoy Titanium member, prefer morning departures—only to have the next conversation start from zero.

This isn't just inconvenient; it's a fundamental flaw for travel planning. Real travel preferences are nuanced and personal. I don't want to re-explain that I'm 6'4" and need extra legroom, or that I avoid middle seats on red-eyes, every time I want to check flight options.

> "Travel booking requires continuity and memory—two things general AI chatbots simply weren't designed to handle effectively."

Professional travel agents build relationships over time, learning that you always book the 8 AM flight to maximize your first day, or that you prefer ground-floor hotel rooms. ChatGPT treats every interaction as meeting a complete stranger.

## Price checking became a multi-tab nightmare

Armed with ChatGPT's suggestions, I embarked on the tedious process of manually checking everything. I had eight browser tabs open: SAS, Lufthansa, and United websites, plus Booking.com, Hotels.com, Expedia, and the direct hotel sites.

SAS showed flights from LAX to CPH for $847 roundtrip in October, but that price vanished when I tried to book—replaced by $1,127 after adding taxes and seat selection. Kayak showed the same route for $892 on different dates. Hotel Sanders was fully booked on my preferred October 15-19 dates, despite ChatGPT's enthusiastic recommendation, while The Nimb had availability but at €485 per night—40% higher than the €345 ChatGPT had mentioned as a "typical" rate.

The manual verification process took two hours and left me questioning whether I was getting the best deals. Without real-time price comparison and inventory access, I was essentially flying blind.

## What purpose-built travel AI actually does differently

This experience made me appreciate services like Otherwhere that are built specifically for travel execution, not just brainstorming. The difference isn't subtle—it's fundamental.

When I texted Otherwhere about the Copenhagen trip, they accessed real inventory through their flight booking systems. Instead of generic suggestions, I got three curated flight options: SAS direct for $1,089, Lufthansa via Frankfurt for $967, and KLM via Amsterdam for $934—all with actual seat maps showing available aisle seats in my preferred rows 6-10.

More importantly, Otherwhere remembered my preferences from our previous conversation about a Portland weekend trip three months earlier. They automatically filtered for aisle seats and factored in my United MileagePlus status without me re-explaining everything.

**The execution capabilities I actually needed:**
- Real-time flight and hotel inventory with live pricing
- Price verification across multiple booking channels
- Actual booking capability with confirmation numbers and PNRs
- Persistent memory of personal preferences across conversations
- Ability to hold reservations for 30+ minutes while deciding

## The verdict: Use both, but know their limits

I'm not anti-ChatGPT for travel. It genuinely helped me discover Restaurant Barr's Nordic cuisine in the Nyhavn area and learn that the SMK (National Gallery) has free admission on Tuesdays—details I wouldn't have found otherwise. The AI's ability to synthesize information and create logical itineraries is remarkable.

But treating ChatGPT as a complete travel solution is like using a cookbook to actually cook dinner—you still need ingredients, equipment, and execution skills. ChatGPT is brilliant for the inspiration phase but useless for the booking phase.

> "The best travel planning combines ChatGPT's creative brainstorming with specialized AI that can access real inventory and execute bookings at confirmed prices."

For my Copenhagen trip, I ultimately used ChatGPT for initial research and activity planning, then switched to a specialized travel AI for the actual booking. This hybrid approach gave me the best of both worlds: creative inspiration backed by real execution capability.

The future of AI travel isn't choosing between general chatbots and specialized tools—it's understanding when to use each one effectively.
