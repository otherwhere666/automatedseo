faqs:
  - question: "At what income level does professional travel booking become cost-effective?"
    answer: "Once you're earning $150+ per hour (roughly $300,000 annually), the opportunity cost of spending 2-3 hours booking travel exceeds the service fee of professional concierges."
  - question: "How much time does the average business trip booking actually take?"
    answer: "Initial booking takes 2-3 hours, mid-trip changes average 1-2 hours, and post-trip administration requires 30-45 minutes—totaling 4-6 hours per trip."
  - question: "What specific advantages do travel concierges have over DIY booking?"
    answer: "They maintain direct relationships with airline inventory managers, track route-specific delay patterns, understand hotel upgrade algorithms, and know which properties actually honor elite status benefits."
  - question: "Can travel concierges work with existing loyalty programs?"
    answer: "Yes, professional services like Otherwhere integrate with your existing American AAdvantage, Marriott Bonvoy, and other loyalty accounts to maximize earning and upgrade opportunities."
  - question: "What's the typical cost difference between DIY and professional booking?"
    answer: "Professional booking through services like Otherwhere typically adds $0-50 to trip costs, while DIY booking costs $225-600 in opportunity cost for high earners."

If you're earning $200 per hour as a consultant, lawyer, or executive, that three-hour flight research session just cost you $600 in opportunity cost. Add the hotel hunting, loyalty program juggling, and inevitable rebooking when plans change, and you're looking at $1,000+ in time spent. Meanwhile, a professional travel concierge charges a fraction of that and delivers superior results.

Let's audit where your time actually goes when planning business travel—and why the math has fundamentally shifted for high earners.

## The real time sinks of business travel planning

Most professionals dramatically underestimate the true time cost of trip planning. It's not just the initial booking—it's the entire lifecycle of changes, optimizations, and problem-solving.

Here's what a typical New York to San Francisco business trip actually requires:

**Initial research and booking**: 2-3 hours
- Comparing United's 6 AM departure vs. Delta's 8:30 AM flight across SFO and Oakland
- Cross-referencing St. Regis San Francisco vs. Four Seasons against your SOMA meeting locations
- Checking Marriott Titanium benefits vs. American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts rates
- Coordinating with assistants on Calendly scheduling around flight times

**Mid-trip changes**: 1-2 hours average
- Weather delays at SFO requiring same-day rebooking to San Jose
- Client meeting moved from Financial District to Palo Alto, necessitating hotel switch
- Uber surge pricing forcing last-minute car service coordination

**Post-trip administration**: 30-45 minutes
- Uploading receipts to Concur or Expensify
- Following up on missing United MileagePlus credits from connection
- Reconciling Amex Platinum benefits with actual charges

> "I used to think I was 'saving money' by booking my own travel on Sunday afternoons. Then I calculated that my Expedia sessions were costing me $400 an hour in billable time I could have been working."

The math becomes even more stark for Big Law partners billing $850+ per hour, or private equity managing directors whose deal evaluation time is genuinely irreplaceable.

## When the tipping point hits

The value equation shifts dramatically once you're earning above $150 per hour—roughly $300,000 annually. At this income level, time optimization becomes more valuable than cost optimization.

Consider this scenario: You need to book a last-minute trip to Chicago for client meetings at Willis Tower. You could spend 90 minutes researching American's O'Hare schedule vs. United's, comparing the Palmer House Hilton's proximity vs. The Langham Chicago's amenities, and coordinating ground transportation to avoid Michigan Avenue traffic. Or you could send one text message describing your requirements and receive curated options within 20 minutes.

The DIY approach costs you $225 in opportunity cost (90 minutes × $150/hour). Professional booking through Otherwhere typically adds $0-50 to your trip cost, since the service fee is built into competitive rates negotiated directly with suppliers.

**The arbitrage is obvious**: Pay nothing extra, save 70 minutes, and get better results from someone who books Chicago routes professionally every day.

## The expertise premium you can't Google

Beyond pure time savings, professional travel booking delivers expertise that's impossible to replicate through consumer research.

Travel concierges maintain relationships with American Airlines inventory managers, understand Marriott's upgrade algorithms that prioritize Tuesday check-ins, and track fare patterns showing that JFK-LAX business class drops $800 every Thursday at 3 PM. They know that United's 6 AM departure from Newark consistently runs 45 minutes late due to air traffic control, or that The St. Regis New York has superior car service coordination compared to The Plaza.

> "My concierge knew that Delta releases last-minute Comfort+ inventory on the Atlanta-Seattle route every Tuesday at 2 PM Pacific. That timing insight alone saved me $400 on upgraded seating across six monthly trips."

This institutional knowledge compounds over time. After booking 2,000+ trips annually across multiple corporate clients, patterns emerge that no amount of individual Kayak research can uncover.

## The loyalty program optimization maze

Managing Platinum status with American, Delta, and United while maintaining Titanium Elite with Marriott and Diamond with Hilton has become a specialized skill requiring dedicated attention.

Professional bookers track your preferences across programs:
- Which American Airlines routes from DCA consistently have Flagship First upgrade availability
- Hotel properties like Park Hyatt New York that actually honor status benefits vs. properties that don't
- Chase Sapphire Reserve partnerships that maximize earning potential on hotel bookings
- Seasonal patterns showing United Saver Awards to Europe release 330 days out at 8 AM ET

They also handle the administrative burden: ensuring miles are credited correctly after codeshare flights, following up on missing Marriott Bonvoy points from partner stays, and optimizing earning strategies across Amex Platinum and Chase Sapphire cards.

For executives juggling status across five loyalty programs while maximizing credit card category bonuses, this coordination alone justifies professional booking services.

## The cost of suboptimal decisions

Amateur trip planning inevitably leads to suboptimal choices that compound over time. Booking United's cheapest Newark-Chicago connection through Denver without considering ORD weather delays, selecting the Congress Plaza Hotel downtown based on price without factoring the 25-minute commute to River North meetings, or missing American's web special upgrade pricing that expires 24 hours before departure.

I've seen McKinsey partners book "convenient" 5:45 AM flights from LaGuardia to save $300, then lose half a day of client prep due to 3:30 AM wake-up times. Or choose the Sheraton Times Square for meetings in Midtown East, adding $60 daily in taxi costs and 30 minutes of traffic stress.

> "I realized I was optimizing for the wrong variables—saving $250 on Delta flights while creating $800 worth of productivity loss through poor connection timing and downtown hotel selection."

Professional bookers optimize for your actual priorities: maximizing productive work time, minimizing travel stress through reliable routing, and ensuring seamless connections. The result is trips that enhance rather than drain your professional effectiveness.

## When delegation becomes strategic

The most successful professionals treat travel booking as they would any other specialized function—something best handled by experts while they focus on core competencies.

Otherwhere handles the entire booking process from search to confirmation, not just recommendations. You describe your Chicago trip requirements via text or call, receive 3-5 curated options with actual Delta and American pricing within 20 minutes, choose your preference, and receive confirmation numbers directly in your email.

The service respects your existing AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Marriott Titanium status, can hold United flights for 30 minutes while you check calendar conflicts, and includes no hidden fees beyond competitive market rates negotiated with airline partners.

For professionals whose time genuinely commands $200+ hourly rates, this isn't an expense—it's strategic resource allocation that frees up weekend hours for actual revenue generation.
