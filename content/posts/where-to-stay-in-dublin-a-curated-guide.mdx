Dublin's hotel scene can overwhelm even seasoned travelers—hundreds of options spanning Georgian townhouses, modern towers, and everything between. But here's the truth: you only need to know about three properties. The Conrad Dublin for luxury seekers who want to be in the thick of things, The Fitzwilliam Hotel for design-conscious travelers seeking understated elegance, and The Davenport for history buffs who appreciate old-world charm with modern comfort.

Each serves a distinct type of traveler perfectly, and I've stayed in all three multiple times over the past decade.

## The luxury choice: Conrad Dublin

If you're the type who wants to roll out of bed and be at Trinity College in five minutes, the Conrad Dublin is your answer. This Hilton property sits right on Earlsfort Terrace, a 3-minute walk from St. Stephen's Green and the heart of Georgian Dublin.

The Conrad doesn't try to be cute or boutique-y—it's unabashedly modern luxury. The 192 rooms feature floor-to-ceiling windows, Carrara marble bathrooms with separate rain showers, and Hilton's Serenity Collection beds with 300-thread-count Egyptian cotton linens. Rooms on floors 6-8 facing south offer direct views across St. Stephen's Green, though you'll pay €50-80 more per night for the privilege.

> "The Conrad Dublin understands that luxury isn't about gilt and marble—it's about being exactly where you need to be, when you need to be there."

What sets the Conrad apart is its location advantage. You're a 2-minute walk from Grafton Street's Brown Thomas department store, 4 minutes from the National Gallery's Caravaggio collection, and 6 minutes from Trinity College's Book of Kells exhibition. The hotel's Coburg Bar serves 47 Irish whiskeys and has become a genuine local hangout—rare for a chain hotel—and their afternoon tea service includes Valrhona chocolate éclairs and house-made scones with Kerrygold butter.

The 24-hour business center includes three private meeting rooms and high-speed printing, and their concierge team can secure dinner reservations at two-Michelin-starred Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud or Chapter One with 24 hours' notice. Expect to pay €280-350 per night in peak season, €180-220 in winter.

## The design lover's choice: The Fitzwilliam Hotel

The Fitzwilliam Hotel proves that Dublin can do sleek, contemporary design without losing its soul. This 139-room property on St. Stephen's Green represents everything I love about modern Irish hospitality—confident, unpretentious, and effortlessly stylish.

Sir Terence Conran designed the interiors in 1999, and his touch shows in every detail. The lobby features custom-made walnut furniture, contemporary Irish art from the Kerlin Gallery, and Italian marble floors that feel more like a friend's incredibly well-appointed living room than a hotel reception. The color palette of muted grays and warm blues creates that perfect balance of warmth and sophistication that lesser hotels spend fortunes trying to achieve.

The rooms are studies in understated luxury. Think bespoke headboards in dove gray leather, marble bathrooms with Philippe Starck fixtures, and Italian wardrobes that use space so cleverly you'll wonder why your closet at home feels so cramped. Corner suites on floors 5-7 offer dual aspects over the Green and toward the Dublin Mountains, and are worth the €100 upgrade if you're celebrating something special.

> "The Fitzwilliam Hotel doesn't announce itself with grand gestures—it whispers excellence in every carefully chosen detail."

The hotel's restaurant, Citron, serves modern European cuisine that actually justifies eating in your hotel instead of exploring Dublin's restaurant scene. Their Irish breakfast sources Clonakilty black pudding from Edward Twomey's 200-year-old butcher shop in County Cork, and uses free-range eggs from Ballymaloe's own chickens.

Location-wise, you're directly on St. Stephen's Green with Trinity College a 5-minute walk south and the Temple Bar district about 8 minutes northeast. Rates run €220-280 in high season, €150-190 in shoulder months.

## The character choice: The Davenport

Some hotels feel like they've always been there, and The Davenport is one of them. This former Presbyterian church, built in 1863 by architect Sir Thomas Drew, became a luxury hotel in 1993, and the conversion preserved all the Gothic Revival architectural drama while adding genuine comfort.

The building's ecclesiastical bones show everywhere—20-foot vaulted ceilings, original limestone archways, and hand-carved stone details that remind you of Dublin's layered history. The 118 rooms vary significantly in size and layout due to the building's original purpose, so specific room requests matter here. Rooms 201-206 feature the original church's lancet windows and 14-foot ceilings that make standard hotel rooms feel like closets afterward.

> "The Davenport doesn't just occupy a piece of Dublin's history—it is Dublin's history, carefully adapted for modern comfort."

The Presidential Suite occupies what was once the church's altar area, complete with the original rose window dating to 1863. At €800+ per night, it's absurdly expensive, but also absurdly memorable if you're marking a major occasion.

The hotel sits on Merrion Square's north side, surrounded by Georgian townhouses and facing one of Dublin's most manicured Victorian parks. You're a 3-minute walk from the National Gallery's Irish collection, 5 minutes from Trinity College's Campanile, and perfectly positioned for literary pilgrimages—Oscar Wilde's childhood home at Number 1 Merrion Square is literally across the street.

The Davenport's restaurant, The Lobby, serves reliable Irish cuisine in the former nave under the original timber roof beams, though the setting outshines the food. For better meals, you're walking distance from Michelin-starred L'Ecrivain on Lower Baggot Street or the more casual brilliance of The Green Hen on Exchequer Street.

Expect €200-270 per night in peak season, €130-180 in winter months.

## Making your choice

Your ideal Dublin hotel depends on what kind of traveler you are. Business travelers and luxury seekers gravitating toward contemporary comfort should book the Conrad. Design-conscious travelers who appreciate thoughtful details will love The Fitzwilliam. History enthusiasts and anyone seeking genuine Irish character should choose The Davenport.

All three properties sit within a 6-minute walk of each other in Dublin's cultural quarter, so you're not sacrificing location for style preference. Each handles the basics—fiber optic WiFi (20+ Mbps), pillow-top mattresses, rainfall showers—flawlessly, which matters more than boutique amenities when you're jetlagged.

At Otherwhere, we book guests into all three properties regularly, and the choice usually comes down to personal style rather than objective superiority. We can check real-time availability and rates at each property, then handle the entire booking process once you've decided.

## Getting it booked

Dublin's hotel inventory moves quickly, especially during festival seasons (St. Patrick's Week, obviously, but also the Dublin Theatre Festival in September and New Year's Week). Book 6-8 weeks ahead for peak times, 2-3 weeks for regular travel.

Ready to skip the endless hotel comparison sites and get this sorted properly? Text us at (323) 922-4067 with your Dublin dates, and we'll check availability at whichever of these three suits your style, then handle the booking entirely.
