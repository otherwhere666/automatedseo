faqs:
  - question: "Can Google's AI travel planner book flights?"
    answer: "No. Google's AI travel planner suggests flights with prices but cannot book them. You're redirected to external booking sites where prices often differ from initial quotes—in testing, 7 out of 10 flights had price discrepancies averaging $65 higher than the AI quoted."
  - question: "Are Google AI travel planner prices accurate?"
    answer: "Often not. Suggested prices frequently exclude mandatory taxes and fees. A flight showing $634 ended up costing $681 after taxes. Hotels also show base rates without resort fees, parking, or occupancy taxes that appear only at checkout."
  - question: "How does Google's AI travel planner compare to professional booking?"
    answer: "In testing a family trip to Barcelona, Google's AI suggested $3,847 but actual booking totaled $4,203 (9.2% higher) and took 2+ hours across 4 websites. A professional service quoted $4,156, charged exactly that, and completed booking in 45 minutes via text."
  - question: "What is Google's AI travel planner good for?"
    answer: "It excels at inspiration, destination discovery, and understanding typical costs. It's helpful for single-destination vacations with standard preferences. Use it for research, then book through services that can lock in actual prices and hold flights while you decide."
  - question: "Can Google's AI travel planner hold flights while I decide?"
    answer: "No. Google's AI cannot hold flights—only show current availability. Airlines typically release unsold seats within 24-48 hours. Professional booking services can hold seats for approximately 30 minutes through direct API access while you finalize your decision."

Google's AI travel planner landed with considerable fanfare, promising to revolutionize how we plan trips using artificial intelligence. After spending three weeks testing it against traditional booking methods and services like Otherwhere, here's the unvarnished truth: it's impressive for inspiration but falls short when you need actual reservations. The technology excels at generating itineraries and suggesting activities, but when it comes to booking flights with real inventory and locked-in prices, you'll still need human expertise.

## What Google's AI travel planner actually does

Google's system works by analyzing your preferences, travel dates, and budget to generate comprehensive trip suggestions. Type "plan a 4-day trip to Barcelona under $2,000" and within seconds, you'll receive detailed itineraries complete with flight suggestions, hotel recommendations, and day-by-day activity plans.

The AI pulls from Google's vast data ecosystem—flights from Google Flights, hotels from Google Travel, restaurants from Google Maps, and activities from Google's review database. It's genuinely impressive how quickly it synthesizes this information into coherent trip proposals.

But here's where things get complicated: the AI can suggest a specific United flight departing JFK at 6:45 PM for $487, but it cannot actually book that flight for you. You're redirected to external booking sites, where prices often differ from what the AI initially quoted.

## The booking gap that matters

During our testing, we found price discrepancies in 7 out of 10 flight suggestions between Google's AI quotes and actual booking sites. A suggested American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo showed as $1,247 in the AI planner but cost $1,312 when we clicked through to book—a $65 difference that adds up quickly for families.

> The gap between AI suggestions and actual booking is where most travelers get frustrated. You fall in love with an itinerary at one price, then discover the real cost is higher when you try to reserve it.

Google's AI also cannot hold flights while you decide—a critical limitation if you're coordinating with travel companions or need time to review options. Airlines typically release unsold seats back into inventory within 24-48 hours, meaning that perfect flight combination might disappear while you're still planning other trip components.

The hotel booking process faces similar challenges. The AI might suggest a highly-rated boutique hotel in Rome's Trastevere district, but availability and rates fluctuate in real-time. By the time you navigate from Google's suggestion to the actual booking platform, your preferred dates might be gone.

## Where human expertise still wins

Complex itineraries expose the limitations of pure AI planning most clearly. Google's system excels at straightforward trips—single-destination vacations with standard hotel stays. But try planning a multi-city European adventure with specific airline alliance preferences, and the AI begins to struggle.

We tested this with a London-Paris-Amsterdam-Berlin itinerary over 12 days. Google's AI generated a logical sequence but couldn't optimize for minimal connection times, missed obvious train options between certain city pairs, and suggested flights that would have required separate bookings across three different airlines—a recipe for complications if delays occurred.

Services like Otherwhere approach this differently by combining AI-powered search with human expertise for actual booking. When you text your requirements to (323) 922-4067, the system searches real inventory through professional booking platforms, then presents 3-5 curated options with current prices that can be held for approximately 30 minutes while you decide.

> The best travel planning happens when artificial intelligence handles the heavy lifting of searching millions of options, but experienced humans make the final decisions about what actually makes sense for your specific trip.

This hybrid approach proved especially valuable for international travel with complex routing. Where Google's AI suggested connecting through three airports for a San Francisco to Mumbai trip, a human travel expert identified a more efficient two-stop option that saved 4 hours of travel time and included better meal service—details that pure AI optimization often misses.

## Pricing transparency and hidden costs

Google's AI travel planner displays prices that look comprehensive but often exclude mandatory fees. A suggested flight from Chicago to Rome showed as $634, but the final booking price included $47 in taxes and fees not mentioned in the initial AI suggestion. Hotels face similar issues, with resort fees, parking charges, and occupancy taxes appearing only during checkout.

Professional booking services build these costs into their initial quotes. When Otherwhere presents flight options, the prices include all mandatory fees and taxes—what you see is what you'll pay. This transparency matters significantly for budget planning, especially on international trips where fees can add $100-200 per ticket.

The AI also cannot leverage loyalty program benefits effectively. It might suggest a Delta flight without recognizing that you're Gold Medallion status, missing upgrade opportunities or preferred seating that experienced travel agents factor into their recommendations automatically.

## Real-world testing results

We planned identical trips using Google's AI versus human booking services to compare outcomes directly. For a family of four traveling from New York to Barcelona with 5 nights accommodation:

**Google AI Planning:**
- Initial suggested price: $3,847
- Actual booking total: $4,203 (9.2% higher)
- Time to complete booking: 2 hours 15 minutes
- Number of different websites used: 4
- Booking confirmations received: 3 separate emails

**Professional booking service:**
- Initial quoted price: $4,156
- Final booking total: $4,156 (exact match)
- Time to complete booking: 45 minutes
- Number of websites used: 0 (handled entirely via text)
- Booking confirmations: Single comprehensive email with all details

The professional service cost $47 more initially but saved 90 minutes of booking time and eliminated the stress of coordinating multiple reservations.

## The verdict on Google's AI travel planner

Google's AI travel planner excels as an inspiration and research tool. It's genuinely helpful for discovering destinations, understanding typical costs, and generating initial itinerary ideas. The technology impressively synthesizes vast amounts of travel information into digestible suggestions.

However, it falls short of being a complete travel planning solution. The gap between suggestions and actual booking creates friction precisely when you need efficiency most. For simple trips with flexible dates and standard preferences, the AI provides solid starting points. But for complex itineraries, specific requirements, or time-sensitive bookings, human expertise remains superior.

> The future of travel planning isn't choosing between AI and humans—it's finding services that combine both intelligently.

The most effective approach uses AI for the heavy lifting of searching options, then relies on experienced humans for optimization and actual booking. This hybrid model provides the speed of artificial intelligence with the nuanced decision-making that complex travel arrangements require.

## Getting the best of both worlds

If you're planning straightforward domestic trips with flexible requirements, Google's AI travel planner offers a solid starting point for research and inspiration. Use it to understand pricing ranges, discover activities, and generate initial itineraries.

For international travel, complex routing, or trips where timing and coordination matter, consider services that combine AI searching with human booking expertise. Text your requirements to (323) 922-4067 to experience how Otherwhere blends intelligent search technology with personalized service—you'll receive curated options with real prices, then we handle the entire booking process while respecting your loyalty programs and preferences.

The goal isn't perfect AI or perfect human service—it's finding the right combination for your specific travel needs.
